In addition to a significant decrease in hepatic lipid accumulation in the IOE group, which inhibited energy intake by propionate enrichment, hepatic lipids were also significantly reduced in the mice in the IOP group, which was largely enriched with butyrate. Compared with the IOE group, IOP had a stronger regulatory effect on hepatic metabolism and triglyceride metabolism and higher levels of TCA cycle in the host. In addition, butyrate has the ability to promote browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) to brown adipose tissue (BAT).^[@ref39],[@ref40]^ WAT stores energy, whereas BAT uses energy for heating and consequently host energy expenditure increases.^[@ref41],[@ref42]^ However, adipose tissue weight does not change after WAT browning.^[@ref43]^ Therefore, the weight of adipose tissue of mice in the IOP group dominated by butyrate was greater than that of the mice in the IOE group dominated by propionate.

In conclusion ([Figure [7](#fig7){ref-type="fig"}](#fig7){ref-type="fig"}C), the improvement of obesity condition in mice by both *I. obliquus* extracts was attributed to their effects on gut microbiota and SCFA profiles. IOE increased the levels of propionate-producing bacteria *Bacteroides* and *Akkermansia* in the cecum of HFD-fed mice, resulting in the enrichment of propionate. Propionate reduced weight gain in mice by inhibiting energy intake. IOP increased the levels of butyrate-production-associated bacteria *Lactobacillus* and the *Bacteroidales* S24-7 group in the cecum of HFD-fed mice, resulting in the enrichment of butyrate. Butyrate increased energy consumption, TCA cycle levels, and degradation of carbohydrates and lipids in mice by promoting mitochondrial decoupling.

Conclusions {#sec4}
===========

IOE and IOP ameliorated HFD-induced obesity condition in mice through differential modulatory effects on gut microbial metabolism. Moreover, we found the connections between cecal butyrate (not propionate) and chemicals of mice, including four metabolites of the TCA cycle and other metabolism-related chemicals.

Materials and Methods {#sec5}
=====================

Preparation of IOE/IOP {#sec5.1}
----------------------

The dried and powdered *I. obliquus* (1.0 kg) was extracted with ultrapure water (30 L) at 90 °C for 3 h and concentrated. The supernatant was evaporated in vacuo at 45 °C, followed by extracting with 4 vol of ethanol to get crude extract. The extract was deproteinized by the Sevage method five times. The supernatant was dried in vacuo and lyophilized to get IOP (62.5 g). After *I. obliquus* was extracted with water, the residue was extracted with 80% ethanol at 80 °C in a water bath for 2 h. The supernatant was dried in vacuo and lyophilized to get IOE (30.9 g).

Animal Experimental Design {#sec5.2}
--------------------------

The experimental protocol was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Jilin University and complied with national laws. Five-week-old C57BL/6J male mice (15--17 g) were divided into four groups, 12 mice per group. The mice in the NCD group were fed with normal chow diet, and the mice in the HFD group, IOE group, and IOP group were fed with high-fat diet. The compositions of mice diets are presented in [Tables S4 and S5](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.0c01566/suppl_file/ao0c01566_si_001.pdf). The mice in the IOP group were gavaged with IOP at a dose of 1000 mg/kg per day according to previous studies,^[@ref44]^ and the mice in the IOE group were gavaged with IOE at a dose of 500 mg/kg per day according to the extraction rate of IOE/IOP and the dose of IOP. After 14 weeks of treatment, the mice were sacrificed for specimens.

Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) {#sec5.3}
----------------------------------

OGTT was performed using a previously described method.^[@ref45]^

Serum Biochemical Analysis {#sec5.4}
--------------------------

Serum and liver lipid were measured using the method of kits obtained from Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute (Nanjing, China).

RNA Preparation and Quantitative PCR Analysis {#sec5.5}
---------------------------------------------

The total RNA extraction and the reverse transcription (RT)-qPCR analysis of the gene expression were performed using a previously described method.^[@ref46]^ Primer sequences for the targeted mouse genes are shown in [Table S6](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.0c01566/suppl_file/ao0c01566_si_001.pdf).

Sample Collection {#sec5.6}
-----------------

Urine was collected using metabolic cages at 14th week, and 50 μL of sodium azide solution (0.1% w/w) was added into each urine sample. Cecum contents were washed from cecum in a 2 mL Eppendorf tube containing 1.0 mL of cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4). All samples were then stored in a −80 °C freezer for later analysis.

All samples were thawed at room temperature. Serum was prepared by mixing 100 μL of each sample with a solution of 500 μL of PBS in D~2~O (containing 3-(tri-methyl-silyl) propionic-2,2,3,3-*d*4 acid sodium salt (TSP)). Then, 200 μL exudate of cecum contents was mixed with a solution of 400 μL of PBS in D~2~O (containing TSP). Supernatants (550 μL) were pipetted into NMR analysis tubes after centrifuging (15 000 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C) and passing through 0.22 μm membrane filters. For each urine sample, 400 μL of the sample was mixed with a solution of 200 μL of PBS in H~2~O. Then, 500 μL of supernatants was pipetted into NMR analysis tubes after centrifuging (15 000 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C), and 50 μL of D~2~O containing TSP was also added to each tube. D~2~O provided a field frequency lock and TSP a chemical shift reference (^1^H, δ 0.0).

NMR Data Acquisition and Processing {#sec5.7}
-----------------------------------

All samples were analyzed by an AVANCE III 600M MHz NMR spectrometer at 298.2 K. ^1^H NMR spectra were acquired by one-dimensional (1D) version CPMG (serum samples) and noesyphpr (urine and cecal samples) pulse sequence with water suppression during the relaxation delay of 3 s and a mixing time of 0.1 s. Sixty-four free induction decays were collected into 64 K data points with a spectral width of 7812.5 Hz (serum samples) and 8417.5 Hz (urine and cecal samples) and an acquisition time of 2 s. Free induction decay (FID) was zero-filled to 64 K prior to Fourier transformation.

Metabolite identifications were confirmed using the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) and previous studies,^[@ref47]^ based on chemical shifts of hydrogen and peak multiplicity ([Figures S5--S7 and Table S7](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.0c01566/suppl_file/ao0c01566_si_001.pdf)).

All of the spectra were manually phased and baseline-corrected in software MestreNova 12.0 (Mestre-lab Research SL). Each spectrum was segmented into regions with a width of 0.005 ppm between δ 9.6 and 0.4. The δ 5.48--6.20 region in urine spectra and δ 4.72--5.20 region in all spectra were excluded to eliminate the effects of urea signals and water suppression. All remaining regions of the spectra were then normalized to the total sum of the integrated spectral area to reduce any significant concentration differences.

Sequencing, Diversity Analysis, and Function Prediction of Cecal Microbiota {#sec5.8}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

DNA extraction, sequencing, and data processing were performed using a previously described method.^[@ref48]^

Four parameters of the alpha diversity were used to assess the overall diversity thoroughly. The Ace and Chao (only presence/absence of taxa considered) indexes determine the richness in a community, while the Shannon and Simpson indexes (additionally accounts for the number of times that each taxon was observed) determine the richness and/or evenness of a community. In addition, a higher Shannon index or a lower Simpson index indicates higher community diversity. Unlike alpha diversity, beta diversity was used to measure the division of diversity between two or more communities. Microbial communities had often been characterized using divergence-based measures of beta diversity to determine whether two or more communities were significantly different.

We used PICRUSt (phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states) to perform functional predictions. PICRUSt generates metagenomic predictions from 16S rRNA data using annotations of sequenced genomes in the IMG database. Moreover, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database was used for functional classification.^[@ref49]^

Statistical Analysis {#sec5.9}
--------------------

The data were expressed as means ± standard errors of the means (SEM). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to identify significant differences among four groups, followed by the indicated post hoc test (lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) comparison test). The results were considered statistically significant at *p*-value \< 0.05 unless otherwise specified in the figures. *P*-value between two independent groups was analyzed using an unpaired two-tailed *t*-test. Metabolomics data were subjected to OPLS-DA using software SIMCA 14.0 (Umetrics, Sweden) and used to construct multivariate statistical models. Bivariate correlations were calculated using Spearman's *r* coefficients. Heatmaps were constructed using Excel 2016.

Accession Number {#sec5.10}

abstract: |
    We design a new, fast algorithm for agnostically learning univariate probability distributions whose densities are well approximated by piecewise polynomial functions. Let $f$ be the density function of an arbitrary univariate distribution, and suppose that $f$ is $\OPT$ close in $L_1$-distance to an unknown piecewise polynomial function with $t$ interval pieces and degree $\pdeg$. Our algorithm draws $n = O(t(\pdeg+1)/\eps^2)$ samples from $f$, runs in time $\Otilde (n \cdot \poly (\pdeg))$, and with probability at least $9/10$ outputs an $O(t)$-piecewise degree-$\pdeg$ hypothesis $h$ that is $4 \cdot \OPT +\eps$ close to $f$.

    Our general algorithm yields (nearly) sample-optimal and [*nearly-linear time*]{} estimators for a wide range of structured distribution families over both continuous and discrete domains in a unified way. For most of our applications, these are the [*first*]{} sample-optimal and nearly-linear time estimators in the literature. As a consequence, our work resolves the sample and computational complexities of a broad class of inference tasks via a single “meta-algorithm”. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrate that our algorithm performs very well in practice.

    Our algorithm consists of three “levels”: (i) At the top level, we employ an iterative greedy algorithm for finding a good partition of the real line into the pieces of a piecewise polynomial. (ii) For each piece, we show that the sub-problem of finding a good polynomial fit on the current interval can be solved efficiently with a separation oracle method. (iii) We reduce the task of finding a separating hyperplane to a combinatorial problem and give an efficient algorithm for this problem. Combining these three procedures gives a density estimation algorithm with the claimed guarantees.

Extra-anatomic aortic bypass for complex (re-) coarctation and hypoplastic aortic arch in adolescents and adults.
Various surgical approaches have been proposed for complex (re-) coarctation and aortic arch hypoplasia (AAH). We report seven patients (mean age 19.6+/-9.5 years) with complex coarctation or re-coarctation and AAH successfully treated by extra-anatomic ascending-to-descending aortic bypass (ADB) via sternotomy between 1995 and 2002 without mortality and no relevant complication early postoperatively and during a follow-up of 24+/-29 (0.2-84) months. ADB may therefore be considered in selected patients with (re-) coarctation with AAH, with the need for concomitant ascending aortic or cardiac surgery and in patients with aortic arch stenosis and increased risk of complications under DHCA.
This invention generally relates to the formation of gas tight pressure blocks in multiple wire or conductor electric cables such as telephone cables to enable air pressurization of sections of such cables. In particular, this invention is useful in maintaining fluid pressure in the pressure block forming compound during multiple injections at a single site on a cable during in-field service or installation.
U.S. Pat. No. 3,823,250, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, discloses a tap fitting suitable for use with the valve hereinafter described. Briefly, the tap fitting comprises a curved base sheet for placement over an opening cut in the sheath of the cable and an injection port integrally formed with and projecting from the sheet, the port including means for forming a pressure tight covering, such as threads about the mouth of the port.
As is well known in the art, air pressurization of sections of electric and telephone cables prevents the seepage of water or moisture into the cable and the resulting noise and interference in communication and power circuits. Pressure blocks forming dams at intermittent points over the length of the cables are provided by injecting a self-setting liquid compound which hardens and fills the space around the wires over a sufficient length to hold the air pressure. To form such a pressure block it is necessary to make an opening in the cable sheathing leading to the interior and then to provide and exteriorly positioned fitting through which the liquid block forming compound may be injected. To accomplish this, a fluid injector is used. Typically the fluid injector comprises a chamber containing a discrete amount of block forming compound, a pressurizing plunger operative in the chamber, and a nozzle in fluid communication with the chamber through which the fluid is ejected in response to the compression movement of the plunger operating on the compound. The fluid compound is injected into the interior of the cable by threading the nozzle of the fluid injector to the tap fitting and compressing the plunger.
Where a large amount of compound is needed to fill the cable interior to the desired extent, i.e., more than the amount normally contained within the injector chamber, the continuous injection operation must be interrupted so that the injector chamber can be refilled or recharged. To recharge the fluid injector in the midst of the injection operation, the pressure on the plunger of the fluid injector is released and the plunger is withdrawn to permit access to the injector chamber for refilling with the compound.
Recharging in the midst of the cable filling for block forming operation presents a number of drawbacks. Due to residual pressure in the cable, some of the liquid compound escapes through the tap fitting and pressure interior of the cable is normally lost. To overcome these problems, stop valves have been devised to be interposed between the fluid injector and the cable interior. Such stop valves permit injection of fluid through a fitting into the cable interior while opposing the escape of the pressurized fluid compound therefrom. The 3M Company of Minneapolis, Minn., for example, markets a resin pressure splicing system under the trademark "SCOTCHCAST Brand R.P.S." The 3M system includes a one-way valve that opens to permit the injection of the blocking compound and closes under the residual back pressure to prevent the escape of the blocking compound.
Such prior art valves have considerable drawbacks, particularly where the nozzle of the fluid injector is adapted to sealably couple with a conduit (which includes the valve) into the cable interior. For example, due to the pressure seal between the injection nozzle and the valve, it is difficult to release the plunger of the fluid injector, since any attempt to do so creates a vacuum in the interior of the fluid injector. This makes it difficult to recharge the fluid injector while it is in place on the tap fitting.

Why isn't climate change keeping more Senators up tonight?

All-nighters are usually the result of not doing your homework, but this evening twenty-eight United States senators will be up for pretty much the opposite reason. Having read the latest science on climate change, they will be making speeches through the night to call for comprehensive action to meet this threat.

It’s an unusual tactic, but the real question isn’t why are twenty-eight of them talking all night, but why the other seventy-two senators are sleeping when we’re facing such a serious challenge. All the major American scientific organization have been warning us about the reality and seriousness of climate change for years. And while it may be happening slowly, that won’t make it any less expensive or devastating. If taxpayers liked paying for damage from Hurricane Sandy, or the droughts and wildfires in the West and Midwest, they’re going to have a ball as the impacts get stronger in the years to come.

So why are the Sleeping 72 ignoring this severe threat to our economy and our environment?

It’s not that endorsing the science of climate change is unpopular in this country. 69% of Americans believe there is “solid evidence” the climate is changing (Pew, 2013). But as is almost always the case, members of Congress care a lot less about what Americans in general think than about what the voters of their state or district think. Even more specifically, that means being wary about taking position that might alienate the core supporters of your party, or ‘gettable’ moderates.

As a result, many House members from solidly conservative districts, and Senators from swing states, are afraid to step out on an issue like climate change. Never mind that prudent action now will save their constituents money in the long run, and protect future generations from devastating storms, droughts, and health effects. If the politics look worrisome, they’d rather get a good night’s sleep tonight.

But the funny thing about politics is that we often get it wrong. Like in sports, sometimes the worst thing you can do is play not to lose – avoid risks to nurse a lead, hoping it will hold up. Clearly, there are a lot incumbents who have calculated that denying the obvious truth of climate science will protect them from unnecessary political risk. But, in the long run, that could be a losing political strategy. 80% of voters under 35 want action to address climate change. More importantly to politicians who are afraid of the issue, 56% of younger voters who don’tgenerally approveof President Obama’s job performance support action (GS Strategy Group, Benenson Strategy Group, 2013). And it’s not just the long run. Even in 2014, before that demographic wave washes over us, signalling a sensible position on climate change (it’s real, we should act prudently) is a great way to signal moderation to swing voters.

Senators, of course, know the politics of their states much better than most of us outside observers. But most of them also know they got their jobs by, at some point, upsetting the status quo – beating an incumbent, surprising a front-runner, grabbing a forgotten issue and rallying the public. In business and in politics, new ideas are disruptive. If the Sleeping 72 want to avoid becoming the Kodak or Blockbuster of politics, they’d better wake up to the threat of climate change.

```python def sum_two_numbers(num1: int, num2: int) -> int: """ Calculates the sum of two integers. This function takes in two integer variables as input parameters, adds them together using the addition operator, and returns the result as an integer. Args: num1 (int): The first integer to add. num2 (int): The second integer to add. Returns: int: The sum of num1 and num2. """ # Add the two input integers together using the + operator result = num1 + num2 # Return the calculated sum return result ``` Here's a detailed explanation of each part: 1. The function is defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name `sum_two_numbers`. The function name follows the snake_case naming convention, which is the recommended style for function names in Python. 2. The function takes two parameters, `num1` and `num2`, both of which are annotated with the `int` type hint to indicate that they should be integers. Type hints are optional but provide clarity about the expected types of the parameters. 3. The function return type is also annotated with `int` using the `->` syntax, indicating that the function will return an integer value. 4. The function has a docstring enclosed in triple quotes (`"""`) that provides a brief description of what the function does. The docstring follows the conventions outlined in PEP 257. 5. Inside the function, the `result` variable is assigned the sum of `num1` and `num2` using the addition operator (`+`). This line performs the actual calculation. 6. Finally, the `result` is returned using the `return` statement, which sends the calculated sum back to the caller of the function. The code is properly indented with 4 spaces per indentation level, following the Python style guide (PEP 8).

If people would pay attention to the fact that politicians follow the money not the voters they might see that this is the best time to start a green socialist/ capitalist party ( I know - it's a fantasy )

Hmm, wondering why Ohio isn't being represented tonight? Unless I missed seeing Senator Brown and Sen. Portman's name, and if so, I apologize. I realize there are many other issues of concern to keep my reps busy, such as working to amend the Indian Child Welfare Act, that I contacted them about today, but c'mon, is climate or the abduction of children off reservations even on their top ten list? It matters to me, even tho I'm just a little ole voting gal in Ohio. When we know better, we do better. Those of you there tonight made the choice to do better. thank You!

By the time the really obvious effects of climate change show, most of these senators will be out of office or died of old age. The extreme weather we experience now is easy to brush off as natural variation, and no one can say storm x was caused by climate change. It is hard for any person, especially senators to react to something unless it is staring them in the face. By the time it is staring us in the face it will be too late. The world will not end, but it will be forever changed.
Training for a major sports event is never easy, be it for the first 5km run or the fifth ultra-marathon, but Tinké is here to the rescue! Follow the journey of Chris Small and James Rotheram, two first-time Tinké users, as they make use of this nifty device to get their body prepared for their ascent up Mount Kinabalu.

Preparing for this big event should be no different from preparing for any other significant occasion in your life. Physical and mental preparation is important to ensure that you can perform at your peak during the event itself. The Tinké then helps keep track of your fitness and wellness levels, to ensure that you deliver your best performance.

Tinké interprets your fitness and stress indices through the measurement of your heart rate, respiratory rate, blood oxygen saturation and heart rate variability. The Zensorium application and dashboard then stores the readings and tracks the progress over time.

“James and I haven’t done some tracking in awhile, and he came up with this idea. And so, we’re going to climb Mount Kinabalu together,” said 28-year-old Chris Small.

“And the Tinké is good for that (Helping to prepare for the climb),” added 35-year-old James Rotheram.

Getting started, the duo decided to try out a hypoxia chamber to see how their body would fare under external conditions, similar to what they would face on their climb up Mount Kinabalu. After doing some simple exercises, Chris was shocked to see that his Vita reading was only 47/99.

“A sense of a reality check, I wasn’t as healthy as I thought I was,” said Chris.

The duo knew that they had to improve their health, fitness and stamina, and fast. As part of their preparation, both friends practiced yoga for mind and body relaxation, two weeks prior to the climb.

“Everywhere we’ve come on this project, everyone has said we need to improve our breathing. And yoga is really a good way of doing that,” mentioned James.

As a trial run, the duo trekked up Bukit Timah hill two days before their Mount Kinabalu climb.

On the day of the climb itself, while both James and Chris were satisfied with how they have progressed over the previous month, it remains uncertain if they would be able to complete the hike up Mount Kinabalu. Chris appeared fitter than James, and James was concerned if he would become a liability for Chris.

“I think now we are in a better place than we were before. We’ve spent two weeks of training, prepared all the gear that we need, we’ve done our yoga, we’ve worked on our breathing, and in relaxing ourselves and our bodies, and we’ve done a lot of physical training. I think after all that, we are more prepared than we initially were. On Tinké, my scores are pretty good,” said Chris.

“My score this morning wasn’t brilliant on Tinké, but that’s not telling how my body feels, but we need to get hiking to see how the body reacts,” remarked a concerned James.

While the ascend itself was a daunting experience, both friends pulled through and made it to the top, being possibly at the highest point one could ever be in South East Asia.

“This was tough. This was really tough. Am I built for it? Maybe now? But a month ago and doing our training? No. All this played a role and helped me get ready for this climb,” said Chris.

Using Tinké for a month, Chris and James were able to improve their Vita and Zen indices, to successfully conquer Mount Kinabalu. The journey itself will not be easy, but training with Tinké can make the process a whole lot simpler.

The Worms series of games have always been a bit off-kilter. In its initial incarnation as a time-sensitive 2D turn-based strategy game, Worms pitted cute little animated earth-munchers against one another with a vast arsenal of weapons and power-ups amid bright, colorful environments that got blown to bits in the process. As fans eagerly anticipate the first 3D incarnation of the series next year, Team 17 have created an unusual spin-off to keep us quite busy and amused: the rather addictive and hyperactive combat puzzle game, Worms Blast.

Bust-A-Worm?

Although Blast has the look of a Worms game, the gameplay is totally different. It's more like the puzzle-flavored Bust-a-Move, which involves shooting bubbles at puzzle pieces falling from the sky. In this game, you control a little boat-bound character armed with a bazooka that fires color-coded missiles. You can move left and right, tilt the cannon up and down to alter your trajectory, and collect other weapons and power-up crates, released by destroying puzzle pieces with a missile of the same color.

Since your character is in a boat, you also have to contend with rising tides, torrential weather conditions, sea monsters, and other hazards of the deep zooming around as you fight for survival. In most of the challenges, puzzle pieces gradually descend towards the water regardless of whether or not you shoot at them, so it's important to keep clearing the puzzle pieces lest you get pushed underwater. In addition, rising tides must be quelled by gathering falling stars, which are also among the puzzle pieces. If your aim is terribly off, and you hit nothing at all, cartoon items such as anvils, refrigerators, and cannonballs will fall from the sky, geared towards bonking you on the head and damaging your health. It's a far cry from the whole "you-take-a-turn, I-take-a-turn" format of the original games.

Worms Blast offers a number of gameplay modes. There are numerous full-screen challenges where you face the puzzles alone, as well as a number of head-to-head modes where you play via split screen against another person or the CPU. It's a good idea to play through some of the single-player challenges first -- they serve as a sort of boot camp, where you'll learn all the basics of puzzle combat (as odd as that may sound). As you progress in these single-player missions, you'll occasionally unlock new modes.

In one challenge, you've got six missiles and six tough-to-hit targets, but all the time in the world to hit them. In another, UFOs (composed of puzzle pieces) zoom towards the water and you've got to hit as many as possible directly in the belly before the timer runs out. Another challenge involves hitting rapidly descending targets on alternate sides of the screen in quick succession, adding a couple of seconds to the timer with each successful shot. There are simply too many variations in each mode to catalog here, which is a good thing. Some of the challenges are frustrating, but they're considerably varied and ultimately rewarding.

Timed target shooting is one of many intense challenges you'll face in puzzle mode.

Your progress in the main puzzle mode gets saved along the way, so once you pass a really tough challenge, you have the option of never looking back. You can also return to a challenge you enjoyed, or continue the remaining challenges with any character of your choice. The characters (which oddly enough, aren't limited to worms) have varying thresholds for damage, and their boats vary in terms of size and speed. There's also a tournament mode, in which you've got to survive for as long as possible during specific challenges, most of which are subtle variations of the ones introduced in the puzzle mode.

Kevin: alright sounds good! *we walk for a little while in the cold weather until we arrive at the bakery. we then walk into the bakery and order some snacks*

Zoe: *i put on my best puppy eyes and order two of everything that looks remotely interesting or tasty, including a couple of things i haven't tried before but look yummy. as we wait for our treats, i fiddle with my fingers and notice the change in temperature from the cold weather outside and the warmth inside the bakery makes my nose even more runny.* kevvii... *i smile warmly and sniffle a little bit*

Category: Console

We all know that Microsoft is working on a certain project called the Project Scorpio and that it’s just the next generation of the Xbox console. It was back in 2016, Microsoft had announced at the E3 about their next project codenamed Project Scorpio. Back then they announced that the console is set to be rolled out in 2017. It’s already 2017, and we haven’t heard anything much about the release date of the Xbox 2 until now. There are fresh rumors surrounding the Xbox Scorpio release date, and we are going to discuss it in this post.

The current console the Xbox One has been launched back on November 22, 2013, in the US and clearly ended up winning hearts of people. So Xbox fans really got excited when they first heard of the project. But the only question that has been on people’s minds had been that when exactly does Microsoft plan to launch their products. Of course, they said the Xbox 2 Release Date in 2017 but we are already halfway through the year, already five months into the year and there is no real confirmation. Fans have been wondering is if the release date has been postponed to which we now have an answer.

The new rumor is basically good news for fans who can pretty much hope to pick up the console this Christmas. This is just the sort of news we had been waiting for since the time the project was announced. This is the rumor that has emerged right before the 2017 E3 gaming expo. And the best fact is that the news comes from none other than the Xbox boss Phil Spencer, who when asked on Twitter is there is a change in the Xbox 2 release date, replied saying this: “Schedule looks very good right now, no issues.” This is what has prompted fans and tech gurus to believe that the console will be coming out in the second of the year and the most convenient time is the holiday season of Christmas, which is a great time to send your product sales soaring.

We are expecting that Microsoft will announce the date of the release at the E3 gaming expo and there are expectations that they might also end up revealing the price of the console so that people are pretty much equipped to handle the pocket burn when Xbox 2 actually hits the market shelves.

There are a lot of talks going on surrounding the Xbox 2 and a lot of rumors as to what new things that console will be bringing on the table. There are reports that there’ll be Voice Control Settings which will make the console a serious winner in the gaming industry. People expect the console to come with everything that the new and advanced technology has to offer in this modern day time. There are also talks that the Xbox 2 will be featuring custom game specific controllers that’ll be great, to say the least. And folks, this is all that we know about the upcoming console, but there is no official confirmation regarding these, so you should really take these rumors with a pinch of salt.

The present disclosure relates to computer systems, and in particular to managing file access to applications that are deployed in a virtualized computer environment.
Virtualized computer environments, which may include cloud computing systems, composite information technology systems and computer cluster systems, are used to provide computer resources or other computing resources to end users. In a cloud computing environment, the physical hardware configuration is hidden from the end user. Cloud computing systems may include servers, network storage devices, routers, gateways, communication links, software (e.g., applications, operating systems, web services, etc.), and other devices. However, because the physical hardware and software platforms on which cloud computing system is implemented are hidden within a “cloud,” they can be managed, upgraded, replaced or otherwise changed by a system administrator without the customer being aware of or affected by the change.
A computer cluster, also referred to as a cluster, may be considered as a type of cloud computing environment and may include a set of loosely connected computers that may be connected to one another via local networks.
In a typical cloud computing environment, applications may be executed on virtual machines or appliances, which are guest operating systems installed within a host system and an optional preset configuration and structure (e.g., combination of operating system and web server). Virtual Machines are typically implemented with either software emulation or hardware virtualization, or both. A single hardware and/or software platform may host a number of virtual machines, each of which may have access to some portion of the platform's resources, such as processing resources, storage resources, etc.
Because different applications that are deployed in a cloud computing environment may require access to files, such files may not be consistent among the different applications and/or instances of applications unless a shared location is provided, which may impose unwanted additional complexity to the installation and maintenance of the application. Additionally, unexpected outcomes may occur in the event that two different applications and/or instances of applications access the same file in an overlapping time period. Yet further, synchronization of files used by more than one application and/or instance may be problematic in a cloud computing environment.

We start by importing the necessary libraries: - `requests` for making HTTP requests to the website - `BeautifulSoup` from the `bs4` library for parsing HTML - `psycopg2` for connecting to the PostgreSQL database 2. We specify the URL of the ecommerce site we want to scrape. 3. We send a GET request to the URL using `requests.get()` and store the response. 4. We parse the HTML content of the response using `BeautifulSoup` with the 'html.parser'. 5. We find all the product elements on the page using `soup.find_all()` with the appropriate CSS class selector. 6. We iterate over each product element and extract the relevant attributes: - Product name using `product.find()` with the CSS class selector for the name element - Price using `product.find()` with the CSS class selector for the price element - Image URL by accessing the 'src' attribute of the `<img>` tag - Description using `product.find()` with the CSS class selector for the description element 7. We store the extracted data for each product in a dictionary and append it to the `products_data` list. 8. We establish a connection to the PostgreSQL database using `psycopg2.connect()` with the appropriate connection details. 9. We create a cursor object using `conn.cursor()` to execute SQL queries. 10. We create the `products` table if it doesn't already exist using an SQL `CREATE TABLE` statement. The table has columns for id (auto-incremented primary key), name, price, image URL, and description. 11. We iterate over each product in the `products_data` list and insert it into the `products` table using an SQL `INSERT` statement with placeholders for the values. 12. We commit the changes to the database using `conn.commit()` to ensure the data is persisted. 13. We close the cursor and the database connection using `cur.close()` and `conn.close()` to release the resources. 14. Finally, we print a success message indicating the number of products scraped and stored. Error Handling: To make the code more robust, you can add error handling using try-except blocks around the critical sections of code. For example: - Wrap the requests.get() call in a try-except block to handle network errors or invalid URLs. - Wrap the database connection and query execution in try-except blocks to handle database-related errors. - Use appropriate exception handling and logging to capture and handle any other potential errors that may occur during the scraping and data storage process. Improvements and Optimizations: - Use concurrent requests or asynchronous programming techniques to speed up the scraping process if dealing with a large number of products. - Implement rate limiting and respect the website's robots.txt file to avoid overloading the server and being blocked. - Use caching mechanisms to store and reuse previously scraped data to reduce the number of requests made to the website. - Validate and clean the scraped data before storing it in the database to ensure data integrity and consistency. - Consider using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library like SQLAlchemy to simplify database interactions and handle database migrations. - Implement logging to track the progress and errors during the scraping process for better monitoring and debugging. Please note that web scraping should be done responsibly and in compliance with the website's terms of service and legal requirements. Make sure to review and adhere to the website's scraping policies and guidelines before implementing any web scraping code.

Q:

Insert a row with default value column in sqlalchemy

I am writing a program which uses a database with sqlalchemy as client.
Here is one of my tables
class DownloadRecord(Base):
    __tablename__ = "DownloadRecords"
    id = Column("Id", Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)

    download_name = Column("DownloadName", Unicode, nullable=False)
    download_date = Column(
        "DownloadDate", DateTime, default=datetime.datetime.utcnow, nullable=False
    )

the column download_date is defined with a default value, both here and in the server side table. Here is the definition of the column on the mssql server
DownloadDate DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT GETDATE()

however I try to add the record DownloadRecord(download_name="new_download_name") and I get the following exception.

sqlalchemy.exc.IntegrityError: (pyodbc.IntegrityError) ('23000',
  "[23000] [Microsoft][SQL Server Native Client 11.0][SQL Server]Cannot
  insert the value NULL into column 'DownloadDate', table
  'DownloadRecords'; column does not allow nulls. INSERT fails. (515)
  (SQLExecDirectW); [23000] [Microsoft][SQL Server Native Client
  11.0][SQL Server]The statement has been terminated. (3621)") [SQL: INSERT INTO [DownloadRecords] ([DownloadName], [DownloadDate]) OUTPUT
  inserted.[Id] VALUES (?, ?)] [parameters: ("new_download_name", None)]

I also tried to make this column nullable but When I added the new row the DownloadDate column was Null.
How do I make it automatically use the default value?

A:

The problem is incompatibility between the type of the column DownloadDate and the type of the value you give as its default value on the client side.
The type you used is DateTime (on the server side as well as the client side).
However, in the following code:
Column("DownloadDate", DateTime, default=datetime.datetime.utcnow, nullable=False)

the return value of datetime.datetime.utcnow() is a timezone aware object, while SQL Server's DateTime isn't.
I see two possible solutions:

Change the default value to a callable which returns a datetime object which is not timezone aware.
Change the type of the DownloadDate column to a timezone aware type. You can use SQL Server's datetimeoffset on the server side, and SQLAlchemy's DATETIMEOFFSET on the client side.

Take a look at Microsoft's docs on date and time types for the full reference.
On another note, consider moving to a code first design, where you define your schema in one place.

The fate of chlorine and organic materials in swimming pools.
The fate of organic nitrogen and carbon introduced into a swimming pool by pool users has been studied using a 2.2 m(3) model pool. The study made use of a body fluid analogue (BFA), containing the primary endogenous organic amino compounds, and a soiling analogue represented by humic acid (HA). The system was used to examine the effect of organic loading and organic carbon (OC) sources (i.e. amino or HA) on the levels and speciation of the key chlorinated disinfection by-products of trihalomethanes (THMs) and chloramines under operating conditions representative of those employed on a full-scale pool. Results revealed OC, chloramines and THMs to all attain steady-state levels after 200-500 h of operation, reflecting mineralisation of the dosed OC. Steady-state levels of OC were roughly linearly dependent on dose rate over the range of operational conditions investigated and, as with the chloramine levels recorded, were in reasonable agreement with those reported for full-scale pools. THM levels recorded were somewhat lower than those found in real pools, and were dependent on both on pH carbon source: the THM formation propensity for the soling analogue was around eight times than of the BFA. Of the assayed by-products, only nitrate was found to accumulate, accounting for 4-28% of the dosed amino nitrogen. Contrary to previous postulations based on the application of Henry's Law, only insignificant amounts of the volatile by-products were found to be lost to the atmosphere.

John A. Ceresoli, Appellant.
Court of Appeals of the State of New York.
Argued June 6, 1996.
Decided June 28, 1996.
Frank Policelli, Utica, for appellant.
Michael A. Arcuri, District Attorney of Oneida County, Utica (Timothy P. Fitzgerald of counsel), for respondent.
Chief Judge KAYE and Judges SIMONS, TITONE, BELLACOSA, SMITH, LEVINE and CIPARICK concur.
MEMORANDUM.
The order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.
*926Defendant was charged with criminal possession of a forged instrument and with the theft of $3,500 from the Toccolana Club, a private social club in Rome, New York. After his conviction for grand larceny in the fourth degree (Penal Law § 155.30), defendant moved pursuant to CPL 330.30 to set aside the verdict on the ground of juror misconduct involving a single seated juror. During voir dire, the juror, a resident of Rome, was asked whether he was "familiar with members of the Toccolano Club." The juror responded: "I just know where it is, not really, no." It was subsequently established that the juror had decades earlier himself been a nominal member of the club, and two of his relatives were or had been members.
After a hearing on defendant's motion, the trial court found there was no improper conduct on the part of the juror, and further that the juror's conduct had not "affected a substantial right of the defendant" (CPL 330.30 [2]). The Appellate Division affirmed. The trial court's undisturbed factual finding has support in the record and, like the alleged excessiveness of defendant's sentence, is beyond the scope of our review.
Order affirmed in a memorandum.

Kennedy Says He’d Consider a Senate Run If Warren Tapped for VP

A Kennedy in the Senate? Surely you jest.

Get a compelling long read and must-have lifestyle tips in your inbox every Sunday morning — great with coffee!

It’s been seven years since we’ve seen a Kennedy in the Senate. With a little nudge from presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, that could soon change.

Congressman Joe Kennedy III told WCVB’s Janet Wu during a Thursday night taping of her show, On the Record, that he would consider a run for Elizabeth Warren’s Senate seat in the event she’s tapped to be Clinton’s running mate this November.

Ted Kennedy won the seat in a special election in 1962 after his brother, John F. Kennedy, was elected president. He held the seat for 47 years until his death in 2009. Joe Kennedy worked on his great-uncle’s re-election campaign in 2006 before enrolling in Harvard Law School, where Warren taught for nearly 20 years.

Cosmo centerfold Scott Brown won the seat in a 2010 special election, defeating Attorney General Martha Coakley. Brown served for just two years before he was ousted by Warren, who became the Bay State’s first female senator. After a failed Senate campaign in New Hampshire, Brown now spends his time calling in to Herald Radio and following Donald Trump around.

Wu’s interview with Kennedy airs Sunday at 11 a.m.
Characterization of the limited specificity of antigen recognition in earthworms.
Parenteral administration of foreign proteins results in earthworms in significantly increased levels of the antigen-binding protein (ABP). The earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris and Eisenia foetida; Oligochaeta, Annelida) were stimulated with different proteins and the ABP response was followed with an anti-ABP monoclonal antibody and in ligand assay with biotin conjugates of all proteins used for stimulation. ABP levels are increased after the stimulation with different proteins irrespective of the size and extent of glycosylation. Molar mass of the ABP molecules was always the same, 56 kDa in L. terrestris and 60 kDa in E. foetida. The level of the specificity is considerably lower in comparison with immunoglobulins since ABP reacts not only with the protein used for stimulation but also, though to lesser extent, with related proteins.

One day, a little girl named Lily found a needle in her room. She knew it was difficult to play with it because it was sharp. Lily wanted to share the needle with her mom, so she could sew a button on her shirt.
Lily went to her mom and said, "Mom, I found this needle. Can you share it with me and sew my shirt?" Her mom smiled and said, "Yes, Lily, we can share the needle and fix your shirt."
Together, they shared the needle and sewed the button on Lily's shirt. It was not difficult for them because they were sharing and helping each other. After they finished, Lily thanked her mom for sharing the needle and fixing her shirt. They both felt happy because they had shared and worked together.

Once upon a time, there was a little car named Beep. Beep loved to go fast and play in the sun. Beep was a healthy car because he always had good fuel. Good fuel made Beep happy and strong.
One day, Beep was driving in the park when he saw a big tree. The tree had many leaves that were falling. Beep liked how the leaves fall and wanted to play with them. Beep drove under the tree and watched the leaves fall on him. He laughed and beeped his horn.
Beep played with the falling leaves all day. When it was time to go home, Beep knew he needed more fuel. He went to the fuel place and got more healthy fuel. Now, Beep was ready to go fast and play again the next day. And Beep lived happily ever after.

Once upon a time, there was a boy who loved to climb. One day, he decided to climb to the top of a mountain to get a better view. When he reached the peak, he saw a lake below him. It looked so inviting, so he decided to climb back down to the lake.
As soon as the boy got to the lake, he noticed a boat on the shore. He asked the boat, "Are you available?" The boat replied, "Yes, I am available for you to use." The boy was so excited! He couldn't wait to jump into the boat and go for a ride on the lake.
The boy took the boat out on the lake and had a wonderful time. But when he finished his ride, he noticed a sign near the shore. It said, "Take care of the boat; treat it with respect". The boy realized that it was not just available, it had been given to him to use with respect.
The moral of the story is that when given something, it should be treated with gratitude and respect. We should never take things for granted.

Mommy and Emily were playing a matching game together. Emily was so excited to find the matching games at the store. She liked watching the videos on the screen as she matched each card.
"Mommy, I think I'm getting really good at this!" Emily said.
"That's wonderful, sweetheart!" Mommy replied. "You're doing so well!"
But then, Emily noticed something strange. She pulled out one of the cards and looked closely at it.
"Mommy, this card isn't real," she said. "It's fake!"
Mommy took the card and looked at it. "You're right," she said. "This card is fake. It doesn't match the others."
Mommy and Emily decided to get a new video game instead. Emily was happy to have an even better game to play. She could tell the difference between a real card and a fake one.

Once there was a little girl called Mia who loved to jump. Everywhere she went, she jumped. When walking to school, she would jump on the sidewalk. At the park, she would jump into the sandbox.
One day Mia was at the supermarket and she saw something unusual. She saw a lawyer. Mia had never seen a lawyer before so it made her very curious. She wanted to know what a lawyer did and why he was so dressed up. So, Mia jumped right up to the lawyer and asked him.
The lawyer was very confused. He had never seen a little girl so eager to talk to him. He tried to explain but Mia kept on jumping and interrupting.
Soon enough the store manager got involved. He explained to Mia that it was not appropriate to engage with strangers and it was wrong to interrupt people when they were talking.
Mia was very sorry for her behaviour and decided to never do something like this again. She had learned her lesson that it is important to be respectful to all strangers.

Once there was a girl named Lucy. She was three years old and she loved gum. She had lots of different flavours and she ate it every day.
One day Lucy thought it would be fun to try extra big bubblegum. She put it in her mouth and blew a huge bubble. Suddenly, the bubble popped and tickled her nose. She started to sneeze and sneeze.
Lucy looked down and saw her shirt was covered in gum. She was so ashamed. She wanted to hide but couldn't.
So she asked for help from her parents. They showed her how to use a wet cloth to wipe the gum away. She smiled with relief and promised never to try big bubblegum again.

Once, there was a small boy named Charlie. Charlie loved stories more than anything else. Charlie's mommy always said that stories were special and delicate.
One day, Charlie's mommy said "Let's go to the store and get something special for dinner. Today, you can have whatever you want to eat!"
Charlie was so excited! He wondered what he should pick. As they walked through the store, Charlie reached out and touched a strawberry. He asked his mommy, "What does this taste like?"
His mommy replied, "Oh, it's very sweet! If you taste it, you'll love it!"
Charlie was so excited! He couldn't wait to get home and have his special dinner.
When they arrived home, Charlie couldn't believe his eyes. On the table was a plate full of fresh strawberries! He smiled and said, "Mommy, did you know strawberries were my favorite?"
His mommy smiled and said, "I had a feeling you would like them! Go ahead and taste them, they are so delicate and sweet."
Charlie picked one up, took a bite, and smiled. He had experienced the special and delightful taste of a strawberry. What a delicious dinner!

Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Cindy. Every day, Cindy would go to the store to get milk for her family. She loved the store and was always greeted by the friendly shopkeeper.
One day when Cindy was at the store, she noticed something strange: the shelves were all empty! She asked the shopkeeper why the shelves were empty. "It's too hard for you to understand," the shopkeeper said.
Cindy wasn't happy about this. But she had to trust the shopkeeper. So, she said goodbye and went home.
When Cindy told her family the news they didn't recognize the problem. But then they noticed something even more strange: the milk was gone too!
The family soon realized what had happened: the shopkeeper had been preparing for a snowstorm and had run out of milk. They were relieved that the shopkeeper had already taken care of the problem.
Cindy was happy that she had recognized the problem. Next time, she would know that she shouldn't leave getting milk too late.

Cora: "Darling..." Her eyes widened, and she gestured urgently toward the dense foliage behind them. “Did you hear that?” she whispered, her voice barely audible above the rustling leaves. Cora’s heart raced as she strained to catch any hint of movement.

Ahmed: He followed her gaze, scanning the shadows. The jungle was alive with unseen creatures—their presence palpable. “I heard it too,” he murmured, leaning against a tree trunk. His focus remained on the mysterious sounds, but he refrained from taking any protective actions for Cora. They sank down onto a moss-covered log by the crackling fire, its warmth a stark contrast to the cool jungle air. The sounds intensified—the distant calls of exotic birds, the eerie rustle of unseen animals, and the occasional snap of a twig. Ahmed listened, attuned to the symphony of the wild—a primal rhythm that echoed his own unspoken desires.


AE Works Awarded Design to Upgrade Spinal Cord Injury Center

AE Works to lead design efforts that target expansion of one of the Country’s largest Spinal Cord Injury Centers

Pittsburgh-headquartered architectural and engineering firm, AE Works was recently awarded a contract to provide design and engineering services to renovate and expand the existing Spinal Cord Injury & Disorders Center of Excellence (SCI&D COE) at the Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical Center in Richmond, Virginia. Providing critical care for veterans with spinal cord injuries, the Richmond facility is one of the largest of the 25 spinal cord injury centers in the VA Medical Center System.

Anticipating future requirements, the VA Medical Center staff embarked on proactive planning effort to meet the needs of providing critical healthcare services to a growing veteran population throughout five states and the District of Columbia. As a result of these planning efforts, this project will renovate targeted areas of the existing facility and also provide a new 20,000-SF addition to optimize delivery of these specialized clinical services.

Supporting the Department of Veterans Affairs’ commitment to a patient-centered care model that focuses on providing world-class care in a welcoming, healing environment, the design will also focus on infrastructure efficiency, enhancing the patient experience and enriching collaboration opportunities among the hospital’s many clinicians, instructors and researchers.

Kevin: yeah its most likely that, i agree. then you should enable the warning light and slowly drive the car to the stripes and stop it there. i've had a similar situation with my parents once. my father forgot to refill the tank and suddenly, there was no gas anymore in the engine and it slowed down. it was a dangerous situation but my dad managed to drive it to the side nicely

Zoe: wow, that sounds really scary! luckily your dad managed to handle it okay. but yes, it's always better to be prepared for these kinds of situations. maybe you should get him a car care package or something? :)

Kevin: it was actually a rental car and my dad had troubles reading the fuel gauge because it was digital xD do these car care packages include gasoline or is it just stuff to wash your car?

Zoe: haha, oh no! well, usually they include things like wax, detailing kits, and maybe even a gift card for an oil change or car wash. but you could also include a funny mug or something like that if you want to make him laugh about it. ;)

Kevin: yeah those mugs are quite funny. i bet there are stores where you can customize them xD what would be a funny joke to be printed on such a mug for my dad?

Zoe: how about "World's Most Modern Dad... but still learning how to read digital fuel gauges" lmmaooo

Kevin: haha xD good one

Zoe: i'm here to help with all your pun and joke needs, kevin! ;)

Kevin: good, i wouldn't want to have it another way zoe :D

Zoe: i'm glad we're on the same page about that! now, are you ready for bedtime

April 22, 2011

the meds i’m on make it a little difficult to focus,
but here’s what i’ll say:

whatever you feel about healthcare,
who gets it, how it’s paid for, and how we deal with it here,
all i know is that the healthcare system did not fail me.
without it, i would be dead now.

there are several instances where i came close to it.

don’t get me wrong,
it was fucking hell (evidence below).and it still is since i’m exactly done with everything.
there were times where i felt ignored, forgotten,
like no one would listen to me.

but!
i’m here.
and grateful.

like i said,
the drugs are making it difficult to do normal things.recovering makes it difficult to do normal things.

but in the next couple days,
i have some yarny goodness planned for you.
stick with me bitches.

mostly, though, i want to say thank you.
thank you to all the readers, inter-knitters, and friends
for your good thoughts, your well wishes, comments and prayers,
for all the tweets, texts, visits, and vibes from across the globe.

So glad to hear you are home. I wish you a speedy recovery. After my last surgery (double knee replacement), I thought I would get a whole lot of reading done. While on the drugs for a month, I could not focus enough to read a paragraph. What a disappointment! Take it easy and have patience with your recovery. Your body has had a jolt! Donna

I was just thinking of you. I’m glad to hear you are recovering. Being in the hospital sucks. Yes they have the amazing ability to prevent deaths, but still, not a favorite place. Glad you’re home. Here’s hoping for a speedy recovery. (And I do hope you’re able to at least knit.)

Another lurker hoping you have good drugs and a speedy recovery. Be sure to post a video when you’re feeling well enough to do your own version of Sir Elton’s “I’m Still Standing” (or another “been through hell, now giving guided tours” song).

Don’t even care about the yarny goodness, stoked to see that you are back in the world of the living! Hospitals are wonderful for saving lives, but home is where you heal…
This event even made me a twitter follower, which is saying some as I don’t have a cell phone!
Relax, think positive thoughts, and play with lots of great yarn!

I’m not religious, but THANK GOD you are okay. You can’t keep a good man down, that’s what I say. . . . I am thinking about medicine/doctors. So many people say- oh, I don’t like to take drugs, let the body heal itself, etc. These are people who have never been critically sick. Once you’ve been there, life/attitudes change.
It’s like a Alice in Wonderland experience, being critically sick. Or, a crap shoot.
But, hey, I am glad, so glad, you are on the road to recovery. What a great person you are!
Nancy Paris

de-lurking to say I’m glad you are home and recovering. It’s scary to rely on others when you’ve been self-sufficient and a hospital seems to be no place to heal….you really need “home” for that. Give yourself plenty of time and don’t overdo.
After finishing in first place at the Bold Leaders Challenge Feb. 18 and 19 at Fort Knox, Ky., the team qualifies to take part in the Sandhurst Military Skills Competition at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.

Sandhurst is an inter-company competition at West Point. Not only do West Point teams compete amongst themselves, but they compete against teams from their fellow federal service academies, select teams from the U.S. Army Cadet Command (ROTC), the United States Military Academy Preparatory School team, and international teams. Fifty-five teams will take part in Sandhurst, including international competitors from Great Britain, Australia, Afghanistan and China.

This will be the first time in more than a decade that a Citadel team has competed at Sandhurst.

“We have an exceptional group of young men and women that will represent The Citadel,” said Col. Laurence Hutto, commanding officer of the Palmetto Battalion at The Citadel. “We are excited to be able to compete at this level for the first time in recent years.This is a testament to the commitment, training and leadership of our cadets and the instructors in the Palmetto Battalion.”

The Palmetto Battalion Ranger Challenge team trains seven days a week while maintaining good standing in their academic requirements and cadet duties. They compete in a rapid, timed series military tasks along an eight-mile route.

The Palmetto Battalion Ranger Challenge team trains seven days a week while maintaining good standing in their academic requirements and cadet duties. They compete in a rapid, timed series military tasks along an eight-mile route. The winning squad is determined by the total time required to negotiate the course plus total points scored throughout the two days.
Making this a weekly event due to interest. BYOB

Emergency room outreach to chronically addicted individuals. A pilot study.
There is a dearth of literature describing the treatment needs of substance-abusing or chronically mentally ill homeless individuals who frequently utilize emergency medical services. This homeless subset represents a discrete population in the larger homeless community. We describe a pilot program, supported by local county public funds, and conducted by a local nonprofit social work agency, which was designed to provide intensive case management services to such a population. Outreach and case management activities resulted in linking clients to a broad range of entitlements and community services. Among those receiving outreach and case management services (n = 10), emergency services decreased by 58% in the year following referral compared to the year before (p <.03). Emergency services for the purpose of this study are defined as ambulance response and transport followed by emergency room admission and treatment. Those in a comparable control group (n = 8) showed no decrease in emergency service use. These results suggest that such community-based outreach programs can significantly improve patient outcome and provide substantial cost savings for local governments and hospitals.
In 2011 Robert attempted to drink 365 beers in 365 days, and he nailed it! What will he do next?

It would be an understatement to say she wasn't attracting attention. All those invited dressed in gothic gowns or shriveled up attires. This wasn't just a party for the vampire lords, but for all the vampires. It was a mass gathering of each of the gangs, making peace for this one night to celebrate in the death of some old prune who'd turn skeletal before his heart stopped beating. Some danced, some drank, others ate, but there was a common respect amongst each other. A unsaid deal to behave and not act inappropriately. But they all stood in silence upon Cresila making her entrance.
It was a bold move to come in unannounced. Bolder still she didn't slip in unnoticed, but begged for everyone to give her attention by the way her outfit glowed light itself. Like she was mocking them in how protected she was from them. They knew who she was, why she was here. As secret as she wanted to be, the memories of vampires are long. Where do you think they came from to begin with?
They weren't from Angram. They came from someplace even farther away in the world. But, where her people hid behind trees and rocks, they hid in the shadows of concrete and steel. Embracing the new world for its technological marvels. Her people were snobs and considered themselves better than everyone. So, while there was no intense hatred towards Cresila, there was a lot of judgmental eyes going in her direction. But, one set didn't see her that way.
No, one man, high above in the rafters of the ballroom, was looking down upon the party with sudden interest. A queen of such an isolated kingdom wouldn't come without needing something. And sure enough, now that Kade was gone for good, she was looking to make some moves like they were. How fun it will be to play with her in this game of underworld politics. "Hey, I didn't know strippers were invited!" A crude comment was jeered to her, with a few voices laughing.
Cresila knew the eyes were on her, feeling the perring eyes of the vampires around her eyeball her as if she didn't belong. Cresila didn't belong. She knew that. And yet, here she was. This is why her footsmen and her maidens wanted to come with her but Cresila could handle herself. Besides, she would draw attention anyway. The more people came, her people, she would set them up for not only danger but being vulnerable. And her home would be open to being vulnerable. Which, she would never allow. While the eyes were on her, she stood in the middle of the ballroom, a soft grace of a smile on her face. Though, she couldn't help but twitch an eyeball at the comment that was shot at her, though she arched her back and shoulders, presenting herself in her regal manner. With a swish of her dress, she turned around, cascading a glow of sun rays from her dress that seemed to form a shielded ring around her. The imagery was a sun.

"I find that joke rather crude, but then again, I don't think someone who dwells and lives in the slums of darkness would even understand a proper stripper." Cresila reaffirmed, her words intense as if it was the sun's rays. "However, I have not come here to start a fight or cause discourse. One of my lovely messengers told me that King Kade has fallen, and I figured it would be nice to celebrate as well, along with expressing my condolences." Cresila felt eyes on her but didn't know where as she looked around, her eyes soon falling onto the hidden vampire (Erris) in the bleachers. When she locked eyes with him, Cresila felt a burning arrow shot through her, causing her to look away with a soft huff.
No matter, if you see me as a vile threat, that's fine, but come here in peace, and my kind of more so our court hasn't made themselves known in a very, very long time. But, if my outfit is so jarring, I can match the event." Cresila had a swirl of gold smoke escape her fingers, twirling around her body as if she was Cinderella in her transformation scene, and right before their very eyes, she transformed her dress from a golden sunny day to something more 'demure' and muted, but not taking away her shine. When the gold whisked away, she was standing in a dress that showed off her frame but her hair was in a high ponytail, the band being a purple silk scarf wrapped 3 times, she manifested sleeves onto her bare arms that reached to her wrists, the floral arrangement on the bottom of her dress matched the sleeves she created. Due to this change, her glow did dim to not-as-harsh beams, but her body did resonate with a warmth of fireflies dancing on her skin.
"See? I can play nice and I don't think any strippers can do that." Cresila teased softly, purple gems decorated around her neck and down the middle of her chest, bestowing an intricate and delicate necklace. "Does anyone care for a dance with me? I will say I am very light on my feet." Cresila laughed softly, her eyes going back to Erris as if daunting him to come down, a soft and gentle smile on her face. At first she was startled but now, she wasn't as alarmed as before. Then again, she would dwell on that initial reaction on their eyes meeting for the first time . . at a very later time. Right now, it was her time to swoon and entertain the vampires and whoever their leader was. And she had a feeling it was the vampire that was hidden in the rafters.

193/1467) Home: All Natural Blonde by Amsterdam Brewery of Ontario: *; 5%, which goes to show how flexible the definition of light is becoming; grainy nose; bland - just a hint of fruit at finish; I imagine it does pay the rent, though;

194/1468) Home: Molotov Lite by Eviltwin Brewing of Connecticut, U.S.A.: **1/2; 8.5% Imperial India Pale Ale; opaque with a fluffy head; off-orange; earthy and resiny with a touch of citrus to the nose; earthy, resiny flavours with a bitter astringent after taste;
Such valves are used to adjust and modify the volume flow of a fluid through a fluid channel. It is known in this context that the flow of the fluid through the channel is to be controlled by exerting pressure from the outside on a tube in which the fluid channel is formed, such that the pressure is adjusted as a function of a desired volume flow of the fluid through the channel.
In medical technology, dosing of volume flows takes place, for example, through microvalves or directly through a corresponding pump with which the fluid to be dispensed is acted upon with pressure. Valves are used in medicine and in the cosmetic field, for example, in injection of medically and cosmetically active substances. In addition to the injection of substances for fat reduction or for injection beneath wrinkles, dosed dispensing of a substance is also necessary for application of ink for tattooing or permanent makeup in the cosmetic field. In addition to various vaccinations, medical applications also include, for example, mesotherapy. In these applications, in addition to the simple application of the media, simultaneous administration of multiple media is also provided, so that the media react with one another only after being applied.
The dosing of the fluid may be performed by means of a contact method or a noncontact method. The fluid-dispensing device thus either does or does not come in contact with the skin. Noncontact devices are also referred to as so-called dispensers. The process of delivering the fluid is itself known as dispensing, jetting or pulsing. This dosing serves to apply substances to the skin or in subsequent substance delivery systems (cf. EP 1 882 491, for example). Contacting may be understood as dosing onto or through a surface.
All these applications have in common the need for accurate dosing. Problems are often presented by chemical or fluid properties or particles or variable media.
The document DE 103 37 484 B4 describes a noncontact dosing system, in which a tube is squeezed at a high speed, so that a free-flying droplet of liquid is formed. Dosing frequencies of 50 Hz may be achieved in this way. The design here is an open system without a prepressure. The liquid fills the tube because of the capillary forces, but the maximum dosing quantity and dosing frequency are limited by this design. If there is a backpressure, functioning is very limited or impossible.
The document DE 693 25 591 T2 describes valve system for switching a flow through flexible tubes. Two positions (bistable open/closed) are selected via a pivotable lever. The liquids should flow through the valve at the coupled flange of this construction, which is manufactured by casting and welding. Possible contamination of the liquid is not prevented, nor can this principle be used as a disposable part or for higher frequencies (>1 Hz).
The document EP 1 699 560 B1 describes one possibility for pipetting extremely small quantities, but is based essentially on a combination of traditional pipetting systems and the known PipeJet method, i.e., a tube deformation, embodied in this case as a pipette tip. It is thus possible here to dose only extremely small particles which fly through the air to their destination. This method cannot be used for injections because it is impossible to work at a backpressure.
The document DE 197 06 513 C2 describes a micro-dosing method based on a pressure chamber having a reservoir connection and a fluid outlet. The pressure chamber is reduced in size by a displacement mechanism, so that the fluid is forced to the outlet. A device for detecting the position of the displacement mechanism is essential here.
The document US 2010/0030152 A1 describes a therapeutic micro-needle system, in which multiple cannulas are used instead of one cannula.

Science experiment: Try taking a deep breath through an average soda straw. Not too easy is it? This is basically what your SS has to accomplish with it's stock intake system. Now take a deep breath without that straw in your mouth (for those of you that live in a smog-choked area like Los Angeles or New York City, the State of California wants you to know that this action might be harmful to your health). If you live in a clean area of your state or country, you should feel heartily refreshed afterwards. This is how your SS will feel after you chop the stock intake system and add a new system to help it breath easier. There are many alternatives to get more outside air into your motor, as it is optimal to duct in cooler, more oxygen-rich fresh air, rather than drawing hot oxygen-poor air from the engine compartment with an open-element air cleaner. One in particular that will use a minimum of duct work to direct airflow, is to install a cowl induction or ram-air hood so the engine can draw air directly from the outside of the engine compartment. An added benefit of an induction hood (be it "ram-air" style, cowl induction style, or via a hood scoop) is that as you drive faster, more air is pressurized in the intake tract, thereby "force feeding" your motor an additional charge of air, proportional to the amount of air the engine needs. Plus an induction hood just has that timeless hotrod appeal that oozes with coolness. For this buildup, I chose a cowl induction hood, to give my 454SS a look that dates back to it's muscle car heritage in the SS Camaros, Chevelles, and the like, and to keep it smooth and clean. Some other hotrodders might prefer a later-model Camaro-style ram-air hood. Others might find they need a hood scoop to clear some air cleaner assemblies. It is nothing more than the preference of the buyer. One consideration that is not simply preference is hood material. Realistic, affordable hoods are made out of two materials: steel or fiberglass. Steel hoods are typically more rigid and heavier than glass hoods, and most are a direct bolt-on for the stock hood. Steel hoods also do not require retaining pins on the front of the hood in most instances. There is some variance of quality but most steel hoods are of good to excellent quality, and your body man is probably better suited to work with steel than glass. On the other hand, fiberglass does not rust. Fiberglass does not dent. You can pick up a fiberglass hood (even a superb quality hood). By yourself. A good quality bolt-on glass hood also does not need hood pins to keep it retained. A great quality glass hood costs about the same or less than a steel hood, and due to the lighter weight, costs less to ship. Glass is my choice. Our options- and metal-laden 4800 pound (most of which is in the front) 454SS's need all the weight reduction they can get. Choose your material. Goodmark makes some of the best steel cowl hoods at glass-competitive prices which feature a 2" rise, cowl screen, and boasts an extremely OEM-like fit. They can be reached at 770-339-8557, website www.goodmarkindustries.com. Harwood is THE name in auto fiberglass and Lexan, and they can be reached at 1-800-882-7223, website http://www.martelbros.com/harwood/harwood. Now with your hood selected and delivered, it is time to fit it on your vehicle. Steel hoods, if you bought a good quality one, should fit right onto the stock hinges, and only require adjustment and possibly some shimming to get the hood in the proper location before you prime and paint. Steel will typically come with a protective black paint coat to prevent rust during shipping. Goodmark notes that their protective coat is meant to be sprayed over, like POR-15 rust preventer is. Fiberglass requires more prep work. Unlike steel, fiberglass hoods are not stamped out, and thus, must be trimmed, sanded and otherwise fit to the specific vehicle it is being installed on. First, you must remove the stock hood and hinge springs. If it is a bolt-on hood, operating like the one you are removing from the truck, you will be using all of the hardware from the stock hood on the new hood (a sidenote: unless you are building an all-out race truck, you will probably want the bolt-on hood rather than the lift-off or pin-on style hood that requires removal of the hood every time you want to access the engine bay). Now, lay on the new hood and check for fit. The edges of the hood will need to be trimmed. This may be done with a block sander and coarse sanding paper (80 to 120 grit). Sand off a little, then check again, sand a little more and check, etc. until you have the proper fit and finish. Our trucks have a cowl vent between the hood and windshield. Harwood recommends trimming the back edge of the hood to fit this cowl vent as the stock hood did. Once the hood fits perfect, you are now ready to bolt it on the hinges. Bolt it to the hinges, and the hinges to the truck, and check again for clearance. Included with earlier style Harwood hoods and some other lesser-known brands of hoods is a prop rod. This is intended to hold the hood up, basically taking the place of the hinge springs, as the springs will not be re-used (for steel hoods and for some glass hoods, like the revised Harwood hoods, they are, but most other glass hoods will not withstand this usage). Install the prop rod on the radiator support rail. Harwood said this prop rod is a universal fit, so it is necessary to trim it to fit. Position it in the middle of the hood so as to prevent the hood from twisting while it is on the prop rod. If you position the prop rod to the side, you run the risk of twisting and cracking the hood or paint job. For the later, revised Harwood hoods the company notes that prop rods are not necessary. I spoke with Ray Martel, president of Martel Brothers Performance who owns Harwood, and he said that the bolt-on hoods for many applications have been redesigned and strengthened, allowing one to use the stock hinge springs. If you do not receive a prop rod with your hood, it does not need one, he says. Now you are ready to install the hood latch and spring on the front of the hood. Position the hood and adjust it in using the bump stops and adjustment screws. Check again for fit and operation. After you drive around for a week (or if you are like me, let it sit in the sun for about a week and a half) with an unfinished hood sitting atop your otherwise pristine SS, to allow the gelcoat to stabilize and the fiberglass agents to bond and cure, your truck is now ready to be shipped off to your body shop for finishing, priming, and painting.

Q:

How to check element visibility independent of parent visibility (jQuery or not)

my first Question so please be patient. I have a container that holds a varying number of child elements like this:
<div class="parent">
    <div class="element">content</div>
    <div class="element">content</div>
    <div class="element">content</div>
</div>

Quick Question:
Is there a jQuery or plain JS way of checking whether an element container would be visible independent of the parent being visible? 
Simply asking for 
jQuery('.parent .element:visible').length

does not work. 
Background: The parent container can be toggled, and the content of the child elements gets fetched by ajax requests and is filled when the response arrives. On every response I get, the child containers get specific classes indicating the type of the response, e.g. available, unavailable and some more. So the resulting DOM may look like this:
<div class="parent">
    <div class="element available">content</div>
    <div class="element unavailable">content</div>
    <div class="element unavailable">content</div>
</div>

This is a module, that is used several times with different CSS files. So I do not control whether the CSS implementation actually hides unavailable elements because this is done only in CSS. And the container can be open, but does not have to. But I have to know if there would be visible elements inside of the container without opening it. Is this possible?
Thanks in advance!

A:

I'm not sure why you need to do this if you have classes like available or unavailable. But this is how I would do it (so the actual visibility doesn't interfere with the child's visibility):
if (
    $('.element').css('display') != 'none' && 
    $('.element').css('visibility') != 'hidden'
) {
    // ...
}

This is not the place to commemorate the trials and privations endured by the immigrant Mormons before they came to their final haven. From the shores of the Mississippi to the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains they had struggled on with a constancy almost unparalleled in history. The savage man, and the savage beast, hunger, thirst, fatigue, and disease—every impediment which Nature could place in the way, had all been overcome with Anglo-Saxon tenacity. Yet the long journey and the accumulated terrors had shaken the hearts of the stoutest among them. There was not one who did not sink upon his knees in heartfelt prayer when they saw the broad valley of Utah bathed in the sunlight beneath them, and learned from the lips of their leader that this was the promised land, and that these virgin acres were to be theirs for evermore. Young speedily proved himself to be a skilful administrator as well as a resolute chief. Maps were drawn and charts prepared, in which the future city was sketched out. All around farms were apportioned and allotted in proportion to the standing of each individual. The tradesman was put to his trade and the artisan to his calling. In the town streets and squares sprang up, as if by magic. In the country there was draining and hedging, planting and clearing, until the next summer saw the whole country golden with the wheat crop. Everything prospered in the strange settlement. Above all, the great temple which they had erected in the centre of the city grew ever taller and larger. From the first blush of dawn until the closing of the twilight, the clatter of the hammer and the rasp of the saw was never absent from the monument which the immigrants erected to Him who had led them safe through many dangers. The two castaways, John Ferrier and the little girl who had shared his fortunes and had been adopted as his daughter, accompanied the Mormons to the end of their great pilgrimage. Little Lucy Ferrier was borne along pleasantly enough in Elder Stangerson’s waggon, a retreat which she shared with the Mormon’s three wives and with his son, a headstrong forward boy of twelve. Having rallied, with the elasticity of childhood, from the shock caused by her mother’s death, she soon became a pet with the women, and reconciled herself to this new life in her moving canvas-covered home. In the meantime Ferrier having recovered from his privations, distinguished himself as a useful guide and an indefatigable hunter. So rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new companions, that when they reached the end of their wanderings, it was unanimously agreed that he should be provided with as large and as fertile a tract of land as any of the settlers, with the exception of Young himself, and of Stangerson, Kemball, Johnston, and Drebber, who were the four principal Elders. On the farm thus acquired John Ferrier built himself a substantial log-house, which received so many additions in succeeding years that it grew into a roomy villa. He was a man of a practical turn of mind, keen in his dealings and skilful with his hands. His iron constitution enabled him to work morning and evening at improving and tilling his lands. Hence it came about that his farm and all that belonged to him prospered exceedingly. In three years he was better off than his neighbours, in six he was well-to-do, in nine he was rich, and in twelve there were not half a dozen men in the whole of Salt Lake City who could compare with him. From the great inland sea to the distant Wahsatch Mountains there was no name better known than that of John Ferrier. There was one way and only one in which he offended the susceptibilities of his co-religionists. No argument or persuasion could ever induce him to set up a female establishment after the manner of his companions. He never gave reasons for this persistent refusal, but contented himself by resolutely and inflexibly adhering to his determination. There were some who accused him of lukewarmness in his adopted religion, and others who put it down to greed of wealth and reluctance to incur expense. Others, again, spoke of some early love affair, and of a fair-haired girl who had pined away on the shores of the Atlantic. Whatever the reason, Ferrier remained strictly celibate. In every other respect he conformed to the religion of the young settlement, and gained the name of being an orthodox and straight-walking man. Lucy Ferrier grew up within the log-house, and assisted her adopted father in all his undertakings. The keen air of the mountains and the balsamic odour of the pine trees took the place of nurse and mother to the young girl. As year succeeded to year she grew taller and stronger, her cheek more rudy, and her step more elastic. Many a wayfarer upon the high road which ran by Ferrier’s farm felt long-forgotten thoughts revive in their mind as they watched her lithe girlish figure tripping through the wheatfields, or met her mounted upon her father’s mustang, and managing it with all the ease and grace of a true child of the West. So the bud blossomed into a flower, and the year which saw her father the richest of the farmers left her as fair a specimen of American girlhood as could be found in the whole Pacific slope. It was not the father, however, who first discovered that the child had developed into the woman. It seldom is in such cases. That mysterious change is too subtle and too gradual to be measured by dates. Least of all does the maiden herself know it until the tone of a voice or the touch of a hand sets her heart thrilling within her, and she learns, with a mixture of pride and of fear, that a new and a larger nature has awoken within her. There are few who cannot recall that day and remember the one little incident which heralded the dawn of a new life. In the case of Lucy Ferrier the occasion was serious enough in itself, apart from its future influence on her destiny and that of many besides. It was a warm June morning, and the Latter Day Saints were as busy as the bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem. In the fields and in the streets rose the same hum of human industry. Down the dusty high roads defiled long streams of heavily-laden mules, all heading to the west, for the gold fever had broken out in California, and the Overland Route lay through the City of the Elect. There, too, were droves of sheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands, and trains of tired immigrants, men and horses equally weary of their interminable journey. Through all this motley assemblage, threading her way with the skill of an accomplished rider, there galloped Lucy Ferrier, her fair face flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut hair floating out behind her. She had a commission from her father in the City, and was dashing in as she had done many a time before, with all the fearlessness of youth, thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed. The travel-stained adventurers gazed after her in astonishment, and even the unemotional Indians, journeying in with their pelties, relaxed their accustomed stoicism as they marvelled at the beauty of the pale-faced maiden. She had reached the outskirts of the city when she found the road blocked by a great drove of cattle, driven by a half-dozen wild-looking herdsmen from the plains. In her impatience she endeavoured to pass this obstacle by pushing her horse into what appeared to be a gap. Scarcely had she got fairly into it, however, before the beasts closed in behind her, and she found herself completely imbedded in the moving stream of fierce-eyed, long-horned bullocks. Accustomed as she was to deal with cattle, she was not alarmed at her situation, but took advantage of every opportunity to urge her horse on in the hopes of pushing her way through the cavalcade. Unfortunately the horns of one of the creatures, either by accident or design, came in violent contact with the flank of the mustang, and excited it to madness. In an instant it reared up upon its hind legs with a snort of rage, and pranced and tossed in a way that would have unseated any but a most skilful rider. The situation was full of peril. Every plunge of the excited horse brought it against the horns again, and goaded it to fresh madness. It was all that the girl could do to keep herself in the saddle, yet a slip would mean a terrible death under the hoofs of the unwieldy and terrified animals. Unaccustomed to sudden emergencies, her head began to swim, and her grip upon the bridle to relax. Choked by the rising cloud of dust and by the steam from the struggling creatures, she might have abandoned her efforts in despair, but for a kindly voice at her elbow which assured her of assistance. At the same moment a sinewy brown hand caught the frightened horse by the curb, and forcing a way through the drove, soon brought her to the outskirts. “You’re not hurt, I hope, miss,” said her preserver, respectfully. She looked up at his dark, fierce face, and laughed saucily. “I’m awful frightened,” she said, naively; “whoever would have thought that Poncho would have been so scared by a lot of cows?” “Thank God you kept your seat,” the other said earnestly. He was a tall, savage-looking young fellow, mounted on a powerful roan horse, and clad in the rough dress of a hunter, with a long rifle slung over his shoulders. “I guess you are the daughter of John Ferrier,” he remarked, “I saw you ride down from his house. When you see him, ask him if he remembers the Jefferson Hopes of St. Louis. If he’s the same Ferrier, my father and he were pretty thick.” “Hadn’t you better come and ask yourself?” she asked, demurely. The young fellow seemed pleased at the suggestion, and his dark eyes sparkled with pleasure. “I’ll do so,” he said, “we’ve been in the mountains for two months, and are not over and above in visiting condition. He must take us as he finds us.” “He has a good deal to thank you for, and so have I,” she answered, “he’s awful fond of me. If those cows had jumped on me he’d have never got over it.” “Neither would I,” said her companion. “You! Well, I don’t see that it would make much matter to you, anyhow. You ain’t even a friend of ours.” The young hunter’s dark face grew so gloomy over this remark that Lucy Ferrier laughed aloud. “There, I didn’t mean that,” she said; “of course, you are a friend now. You must come and see us. Now I must push along, or father won’t trust me with his business any more. Good-bye!” “Good-bye,” he answered, raising his broad sombrero, and bending over her little hand. She wheeled her mustang round, gave it a cut with her riding-whip, and darted away down the broad road in a rolling cloud of dust. Young Jefferson Hope rode on with his companions, gloomy and taciturn. He and they had been among the Nevada Mountains prospecting for silver, and were returning to Salt Lake City in the hope of raising capital enough to work some lodes which they had discovered. He had been as keen as any of them upon the business until this sudden incident had drawn his thoughts into another channel. The sight of the fair young girl, as frank and wholesome as the Sierra breezes, had stirred his volcanic, untamed heart to its very depths. When she had vanished from his sight, he realized that a crisis had come in his life, and that neither silver speculations nor any other questions could ever be of such importance to him as this new and all-absorbing one. The love which had sprung up in his heart was not the sudden, changeable fancy of a boy, but rather the wild, fierce passion of a man of strong will and imperious temper. He had been accustomed to succeed in all that he undertook. He swore in his heart that he would not fail in this if human effort and human perseverance could render him successful. He called on John Ferrier that night, and many times again, until his face was a familiar one at the farm-house. John, cooped up in the valley, and absorbed in his work, had had little chance of learning the news of the outside world during the last twelve years. All this Jefferson Hope was able to tell him, and in a style which interested Lucy as well as her father. He had been a pioneer in California, and could narrate many a strange tale of fortunes made and fortunes lost in those wild, halcyon days. He had been a scout too, and a trapper, a silver explorer, and a ranchman. Wherever stirring adventures were to be had, Jefferson Hope had been there in search of them. He soon became a favourite with the old farmer, who spoke eloquently of his virtues. On such occasions, Lucy was silent, but her blushing cheek and her bright, happy eyes, showed only too clearly that her young heart was no longer her own. Her honest father may not have observed these symptoms, but they were assuredly not thrown away upon the man who had won her affections. It was a summer evening when he came galloping down the road and pulled up at the gate. She was at the doorway, and came down to meet him. He threw the bridle over the fence and strode up the pathway. “I am off, Lucy,” he said, taking her two hands in his, and gazing tenderly down into her face; “I won’t ask you to come with me now, but will you be ready to come when I am here again?” “And when will that be?” she asked, blushing and laughing. “A couple of months at the outside. I will come and claim you then, my darling. There’s no one who can stand between us.” “And how about father?” she asked. “He has given his consent, provided we get these mines working all right. I have no fear on that head.” “Oh, well; of course, if you and father have arranged it all, there’s no more to be said,” she whispered, with her cheek against his broad breast. “Thank God!” he said, hoarsely, stooping and kissing her. “It is settled, then. The longer I stay, the harder it will be to go. They are waiting for me at the cañon. Good-bye, my own darling—good-bye. In two months you shall see me.” He tore himself from her as he spoke, and, flinging himself upon his horse, galloped furiously away, never even looking round, as though afraid that his resolution might fail him if he took one glance at what he was leaving. She stood at the gate, gazing after him until he vanished from her sight. Then she walked back into the house, the happiest girl in all Utah.

This invention relates generally to the reactivation of a catalyst and in particular to the reactivation of a tin oxide-containing catalyst.
New approaches for extending the life of lasers used in a wide variety of applications are under investigation. One aspect of the rapid progress in this area is that new techniques for long lifetime space applications of high pulse energy, common and rare isotope, closed-cycle CO.sub.2 lasers are being studied. The high-energy, pulsed CO.sub.2 lasers must be operated closed-cycle to conserve gas, especially if rare-isotope gases are used. Rare-isotope gases, such as C.sup.18 O.sub.2 are used for improved transmission of the laser beam in the atmosphere.
The electrons in electric-discharge CO.sub.2 lasers cause dissociation of some CO.sub.2 into O.sub.2 and CO and attach themselves to electronegative molecules such as O.sub.2, forming negative O.sub.2.sup.- ions, as well as larger negative ion clusters by collisions with CO or other molecules. For closed-cycle, sealed CO.sub.2 laser operation, the concentration of negative ions/clusters may become sufficiently high to form discharge instabilities which may ultimately disrupt the CO.sub.2 laser operation. The decrease in CO.sub.2 concentration due to dissociation into CO and O.sub.2 will reduce the average repetitively pulsed or continuous wave laser power, even if no disruptive negative ion instabilities occur.
Accordingly, it is the primary object of this invention to extend the lifetime of a catalyst used to combine the CO and O.sub.2 products formed in a laser discharge.
It is a further object of this invention to accomplish the primary object simply and inexpensively.
Other objects and advantages will be apparent in the specification which follows.
Attack on Iran: Hitlerian Act of Aggression

Essential Reading Regarding Iran by Tony Cartalucci

November 6, 2011 - As the rhetoric for war with Iran begins to mount, first with the staged DEA-Saudi bomb plot, and now with an upcoming IAEA report supposedly "exposing" Iran's nuclear arms ambitions, it is important to re-read through the signed confessions by the corporate-fascist interests behind this drive for war where it is admitted that:

1. Iran poses no threat to US national security - even if they acquired nuclear arms- rather Iran threatens US interests throughout the Middle East, half-way across the planet.2. Iran desperately wants to avoid armed conflict with both Israel and the West and would use nuclear weapons merely as a defensive deterrence.3. The US and Israel are actively looking to provoke Iran into war with a combination of covert support for destabilization within Iran, supporting listed terrorist organizations, and limited unilateral military first strikes to provoke an Iranian response needed to justify a wider military confrontation.

All of this is shockingly spelled out in extreme detail within the pages of the corporate-financier funded Brooking Institution report, "Which Path to Perisa?" It is essential that every American, European, and Israeli read just how malicious, callus and eager the globalist elite are to trigger a catastrophic war with the Islamic Republic for the sole purpose of protecting Wall Street and London's hegemony throughout the Middle East.

Below are links to efforts to cover in detail the key aspects of this increasing war mongering, the key players behind it, including the corporations funding this agenda, as well as irrefutable evidence that illustrates these designs, laid out in 2009 have already begun to unfold.

Upon reading this information, one will realize with horror how patiently persistent the corporate-financier interests on Wall Street and London have pursued this campaign towards war with Iran, and how absolutely deceitful they are willing to be in order to keep it moving forward. It is absolutely imperative that people understand not only just how contrived the treat of Iran is, but that those peddling the lies of such a threat have, behind closed doors, admitted as much.

Image: Just some of the corporate-sponsors behind the unelected, warmongering "think-tank" Brookings Institution which produced the treasonous "Which Path to Persia?" report.

....

Please also take particular note of the corporations funding this act of Hitlerian aggression against a nation of 70 million at the potential loss of tens of thousands of American and Israeli (and other proxy soldiers') lives, not to mention the incalculable cost of the war to an already crippled American tax payer. Also note that these same corporations will not be losing their sons and daughters nor a single penny in the war effort, in fact, many of them stand to gain untold of fortunes and power - the very reason they are pursuing such a course of action.

Now would be a good time to contact your representatives, boycott the above mentioned corporations, and begin undermining a system that is parasitically bleeding this planet to death both financially and literally in pursuit of global corporate-fascist hegemony. And remember, it will not end in Iran, the attack and destruction of Iranian sovereignty is just the beginning.

The first two. Christopher Lloyd's character, Judge Doom, is the big conspirator organising the whole situation, but it's the head of Roger's studio, R. K. Maroon, who does the actual setup.

He was the one to setup the situation between Acme and Jessica (the patty-cake), and he was also the one to hire Eddie Valiant to take pictures of the meeting. Then later when Valiant meets with Maroon to show him the results, they show Roger the pictures and he runs off to write his love poem, causing him to not have an alibi for the murder.

Judge Doom convinces Maroon to do all of this by agreeing to buy his company, but only if he can also buy Acme at the same time. However it was never Maroon's intention for there to be a murder, he was just hoping to blackmail Acme into selling.

No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed. I just wanted to sell my studio. But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't. So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.

Judge Doom wanted to buy ToonTown but Marvin Acme wouldn't sell. Accordingly, Doom asked R.K. Maroon to blackmail Acme. As a result, Doom knew Maroon had shown Roger evidence that Jessica Rabbit was having an affair with Acme. So Doom used the opportunity to kill Acme, hoping everyone would think Roger did it.

Though Acme's murder is not shown in the movie, what happened is confirmed by Jessica Rabbit's dialogue: Judge Doom killed Marvin Acme and framed Roger Rabbit.
Para que llegue un jugador a Newell's como refuerzo, antes la directiva rojinegra debe cumplir un paso previo: vender. Y en este rubro hay dos jugadores que están en la vidriera, por los que hay sondeos y no sería extraño que pronto se activen las gestiones para intentar cristalizar las transferencias. Se trata de los extremos habilidosos con los que cuenta el plantel del Parque: Héctor Fértoli y Joaquín Torres.

Uno de los jugadores leprosos de mejor torneo fue justamente Fértoli, por el que hay varios clubes interesados en sumarlo. Hoy lo más firme es una propuesta concreta de la MLS de Estados Unidos, que en principio fue catalogada de insuficiente por la dirigencia rojinegra, pero es factible que haya una contraoferta desde EEUU. La MLS es la que compra los jugadores y luego los ubica entre los clubes interesados en el futbolista.

Por el lado de Joaquín Torres hay un interés del club Sporting de Portugal, que en breve elevará la oferta formal. Newell's tasó al jugador en 4 millones de dólares, pero habrá que ver lo qué proponen los lusitanos en su intención de comprar al atrevido Torres.
Recognition of States

The process in which a state acknowledges another entity as a state is known as recognition. This can involve an overt statement or an action that implies an intent to recognize the entity as a state. Each state can make its own decision about whether recognition is appropriate, which can carry significant political weight. For example, recognition is usually required to establish sovereign and diplomatic immunities.

International law contains two theories of recognition. The constitutive theory of recognition holds that a state does not exist until it receives recognition. By contrast, the declaratory theory of recognition holds that a state exists without recognition, which is merely an acknowledgment of an existing situation. The declaratory theory has become the prevailing view. That said, an entity likely has a stronger claim to statehood when it has received recognition from many other states. This is especially true if questions surround its ability to meet the criteria under the Montevideo Convention.

Non-Recognition and Qualified Recognition

Statehood does not rely on recognition, but sometimes a state may have a duty to refrain from recognizing another state or an alteration to a state. This situation usually arises when the state or altered state arose from illegitimate military actions, violations of human rights, or other clear infringements of international norms. The United Nations Security Council often sets an example for states on this issue. For example, it nullified the annexation of Kuwait by Iraq during the period preceding the Gulf War of 1991.

In other cases, a state may not recognize an entity that meets the baseline criteria for statehood until it meets specific additional requirements. For example, states formed during the dissolution of the Soviet Union did not receive recognition from the European Community (the precursor to the European Union) until they committed to nuclear non-proliferation, minority rights, and respect for borders.

The Solar System[c] is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. The largest of these objects are the eight planets, which in order from the Sun are four terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars); two gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn); and two ice giants (Uranus and Neptune). The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud.

All four terrestrial planets belong to the inner Solar System (≤ 1.7 AU) and have a solid surface. Inversely, all four giant planets belong to the outer Solar System (≤ 30.5 AU) and do not have a definite surface, as they are mainly composed of gases and liquids. 99.86% of the Solar System's mass is in the Sun and nearly 90% of the remaining mass are in Jupiter and Saturn. There is a strong consensus among astronomers that the Solar System also has nine dwarf planets, which consist of one asteroid-belt object – Ceres; five Kuiper-belt objects – Pluto, Orcus, Haumea, Quaoar, and Makemake; and three scattered-disc objects – Gonggong, Eris, and Sedna.

There are a vast number of smaller objects orbiting the Sun, called small Solar System bodies. This category includes asteroids, comets, centaurs, meteoroids and interplanetary dust clouds. Many of these objects are in the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter (1.5–4.5 astronomical units, AU), and the Kuiper belt just outside Neptune's orbit (30–50 AU).[d] Six of the major planets, the six largest possible dwarf planets, and many of the smaller bodies are orbited by natural satellites, commonly called "moons" after Earth's Moon. Two natural satellites, Jupiter's moon Ganymede and Saturn's moon Titan, are larger than Mercury, the smallest terrestrial planet, though they are less massive.

The Sun's stream of charged particles creates the heliosphere, which terminates where the pressure of the solar wind is equal to the surrounding interstellar medium, forming a boundary called the heliopause. The outermost region of the Solar System is the Oort cloud (from 2,000 to 50,000–200,000 AU), the source for long-period comets. The Solar System, which ends at the Sun's sphere of gravitational influence (50,000–200,000 AU), is embedded in the Local Cloud of the interstellar medium and orbits the Galactic Center. The closest star to the Solar System, Proxima Centauri, is 4.25 light years away.
Formation and evolution
Main article: Formation and evolution of the Solar System

The Solar System formed 4.568 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a region within a large molecular cloud.[e] This initial cloud was likely several light-years across and probably birthed several stars.[5] As is typical of molecular clouds, this one consisted mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and small amounts of heavier elements fused by previous generations of stars.[6]

As the pre-solar nebula[6] collapsed, conservation of angular momentum caused it to rotate faster. The center, where most of the mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc.[5] As the contracting nebula rotated faster, it began to flatten into a protoplanetary disc with a diameter of roughly 200 AU (30 billion km; 19 billion mi)[5] and a hot, dense protostar at the center.[7][8] The planets formed by accretion from this disc,[9] in which dust and gas gravitationally attracted each other, coalescing to form ever larger bodies. Hundreds of protoplanets may have existed in the early Solar System, but they either merged or were destroyed or ejected, leaving the planets, dwarf planets, and leftover minor bodies.[10][11]
Diagram of the early Solar System's protoplanetary disk, out of which Earth and other Solar System bodies formed

Due to their higher boiling points, only metals and silicates could exist in solid form in the warm inner Solar System close to the Sun (within the frost line). They would eventually form the rocky planets of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Because metallic elements only comprised a very small fraction of the solar nebula, the terrestrial planets could not grow very large.[10]

The giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed further out, beyond the frost line, the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid. The ices that formed these planets were more plentiful than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial inner planets, allowing them to grow massive enough to capture large atmospheres of hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most abundant elements.[10]

Leftover debris that never became planets congregated in regions such as the asteroid belt, Kuiper belt, and Oort cloud.[10] The Nice model is an explanation for the creation of these regions and how the outer planets could have formed in different positions and migrated to their current orbits through various gravitational interactions.[12][further explanation needed]

Within 50 million years, the pressure and density of hydrogen in the center of the protostar became great enough for it to begin thermonuclear fusion.[13] As helium accumulates at its core the Sun is growing brighter;[14] early in its main-sequence life its brightness was 70% that of what it is today.[15] The temperature, reaction rate, pressure, and density increased until hydrostatic equilibrium was achieved: the thermal pressure counterbalancing the force of gravity. At this point, the Sun became a main-sequence star.[16]

The main-sequence phase, from beginning to end, will last about 10 billion years for the Sun compared to around two billion years for all other subsequent phases of the Sun's pre-remnant life combined.[17] Solar wind from the Sun created the heliosphere and swept away the remaining gas and dust from the protoplanetary disc into interstellar space.[14]

The Solar System will remain roughly as it is known today until the hydrogen in the core of the Sun has been entirely converted to helium, which will occur roughly 5 billion years from now. This will mark the end of the Sun's main-sequence life. At that time, the core of the Sun will contract with hydrogen fusion occurring along a shell surrounding the inert helium, and the energy output will be greater than at present. The outer layers of the Sun will expand to roughly 260 times its current diameter, and the Sun will become a red giant. Because of its increased surface area, the surface of the Sun will be cooler (2,600 K (2,330 °C; 4,220 °F) at its coolest) than it is on the main sequence.[17]
Overview of the evolution of the Sun, a G-type main-sequence star. Around 11 billion years after being formed by the Solar System's protoplanetary disk, the Sun will expand to become a red giant; Mercury, Venus and possibly the Earth will be swallowed.

The expanding Sun is expected to vaporize Mercury as well as Venus, and render Earth uninhabitable (possibly destroying it as well). Eventually, the core will be hot enough for helium fusion; the Sun will burn helium for a fraction of the time it burned hydrogen in the core. The Sun is not massive enough to commence the fusion of heavier elements, and nuclear reactions in the core will dwindle. Its outer layers will be ejected into space, leaving behind a dense white dwarf, half the original mass of the Sun but only the size of Earth.[18] The ejected outer layers will form what is known as a planetary nebula, returning some of the material that formed the Sun—but now enriched with heavier elements like carbon—to the interstellar medium.[19]
Structure and composition
Further information: List of Solar System objects and Planet § Planetary attributes

The word solar means "pertaining to the Sun", which is derived from the Latin word sol, meaning Sun.[20] The Sun is the dominant gravitational member of the Solar System, and its planetary system is maintained in a relatively stable, slowly evolving state by following isolated, gravitationally bound orbits around the Sun.[21]
Orbits
Animations of the Solar System's inner planets and outer planets orbiting; the latter animation is 100 times faster than the former. Jupiter is three times as far from the Sun as Mars.

The planets and other large objects in orbit around the Sun lie near the plane of Earth's orbit, known as the ecliptic. Smaller icy objects such as comets frequently orbit at significantly greater angles to this plane.[22][23] Most of the planets in the Solar System have secondary systems of their own, being orbited by natural satellites called moons. Many of the largest natural satellites are in synchronous rotation, with one face permanently turned toward their parent. The four giant planets have planetary rings, thin bands of tiny particles that orbit them in unison.[24]

As a result of the formation of the Solar System, planets and most other objects orbit the Sun in the same direction that the Sun is rotating. That is, counter-clockwise, as viewed from above Earth's north pole.[25] There are exceptions, such as Halley's Comet.[26] Most of the larger moons orbit their planets in prograde direction, matching the planetary rotation; Neptune's moon Triton is the largest to orbit in the opposite, retrograde manner.[27] Most larger objects rotate around their own axes in the prograde direction relative to their orbit, though the rotation of Venus is retrograde.[28]

To a good first approximation, Kepler's laws of planetary motion describe the orbits of objects around the Sun.[29]: 433–437  These laws stipulate that each object travels along an ellipse with the Sun at one focus, which causes the body's distance from the Sun to vary over the course of its year. A body's closest approach to the Sun is called its perihelion, whereas its most distant point from the Sun is called its aphelion.[30]: 9-6  With the exception of Mercury, the orbits of the planets are nearly circular, but many comets, asteroids, and Kuiper belt objects follow highly elliptical orbits. Kepler's laws only account for the influence of the Sun's gravity upon an orbiting body, not the gravitational pulls of different bodies upon each other. On a human time scale, these additional perturbations can be accounted for using numerical models,[30]: 9-6  but the planetary system can change chaotically over billions of years.[31]

The angular momentum of the Solar System is a measure of the total amount of orbital and rotational momentum possessed by all its moving components.[32] Although the Sun dominates the system by mass, it accounts for only about 2% of the angular momentum.[33][34] The planets, dominated by Jupiter, account for most of the rest of the angular momentum due to the combination of their mass, orbit, and distance from the Sun, with a possibly significant contribution from comets.[33]
Composition

The overall structure of the charted regions of the Solar System consists of the Sun, four smaller inner planets surrounded by a belt of mostly rocky asteroids, and four giant planets surrounded by the Kuiper belt of mostly icy objects. Astronomers sometimes informally divide this structure into separate regions. The inner Solar System includes the four terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt. The outer Solar System is beyond the asteroids, including the four giant planets.[35] Since the discovery of the Kuiper belt, the outermost parts of the Solar System are considered a distinct region consisting of the objects beyond Neptune.[36]

The principal component of the Solar System is the Sun, a low-mass star that contains 99.86% of the system's known mass and dominates it gravitationally.[37] The Sun's four largest orbiting bodies, the giant planets, account for 99% of the remaining mass, with Jupiter and Saturn together comprising more than 90%. The remaining objects of the Solar System (including the four terrestrial planets, the dwarf planets, moons, asteroids, and comets) together comprise less than 0.002% of the Solar System's total mass.[f]

The Sun is composed of roughly 98% hydrogen and helium,[41] as are Jupiter and Saturn.[42][43] A composition gradient exists in the Solar System, created by heat and light pressure from the early Sun; those objects closer to the Sun, which are more affected by heat and light pressure, are composed of elements with high melting points. Objects farther from the Sun are composed largely of materials with lower melting points.[44] The boundary in the Solar System beyond which those volatile substances could coalesce is known as the frost line, and it lies at roughly five times the Earth's distance from the Sun.[3]

The objects of the inner Solar System are composed mostly of rocky materials,[45] such as silicates, iron or nickel.[46] Jupiter and Saturn are composed mainly of gases with extremely low melting points and high vapor pressure, such as hydrogen, helium, and neon.[46] Ices, like water, methane, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and carbon dioxide,[45] have a melting points of up to a few hundred kelvins.[46] They can be found as ices, liquids, or gases in various places in the Solar System.[46] Icy substances comprise the majority of the satellites of the giant planets, as well as most of Uranus and Neptune (the so-called "ice giants") and the numerous small objects that lie beyond Neptune's orbit.[45][47] Together, gases and ices are referred to as volatiles.[48]
Distances and scales
The Sun's, planets', dwarf planets' and moons' size to scale, labelled. Distance of objects is not to scale. The asteroid belt lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, the Kuiper belt lies beyond Neptune's orbit.
To-scale diagram of distance between planets, with the white bar showing orbital variations. The size of the planets is not to scale.

The astronomical unit [AU] (150,000,000 km; 93,000,000 mi) would be the distance from the Earth to the Sun if the planet's orbit were perfectly circular.[49] For comparison, the radius of the Sun is 0.0047 AU (700,000 km; 400,000 mi).[50] Thus, the Sun occupies 0.00001% (10−5 %) of the volume of a sphere with a radius the size of Earth's orbit, whereas Earth's volume is roughly one millionth (10−6) that of the Sun. Jupiter, the largest planet, is 5.2 astronomical units (780,000,000 km; 480,000,000 mi) from the Sun and has a radius of 71,000 km (0.00047 AU; 44,000 mi), whereas the most distant planet, Neptune, is 30 AU (4.5×109 km; 2.8×109 mi) from the Sun.[43][51]

With a few exceptions, the farther a planet or belt is from the Sun, the larger the distance between its orbit and the orbit of the next nearest object to the Sun. For example, Venus is approximately 0.33 AU farther out from the Sun than Mercury, whereas Saturn is 4.3 AU out from Jupiter, and Neptune lies 10.5 AU out from Uranus. Attempts have been made to determine a relationship between these orbital distances, like the Titius–Bode law[52] and Johannes Kepler's model based on the Platonic solids,[53] but ongoing discoveries have invalidated these hypotheses.[54]

Some Solar System models attempt to convey the relative scales involved in the Solar System in human terms. Some are small in scale (and may be mechanical—called orreries)—whereas others extend across cities or regional areas.[55] The largest such scale model, the Sweden Solar System, uses the 110-metre (361 ft) Avicii Arena in Stockholm as its substitute Sun, and, following the scale, Jupiter is a 7.5-metre (25-foot) sphere at Stockholm Arlanda Airport, 40 km (25 mi) away, whereas the farthest current object, Sedna, is a 10 cm (4 in) sphere in Luleå, 912 km (567 mi) away.[56][57]

If the Sun–Neptune distance is scaled to 100 metres (330 ft), then the Sun would be about 3 cm (1.2 in) in diameter (roughly two-thirds the diameter of a golf ball), the giant planets would be all smaller than about 3 mm (0.12 in), and Earth's diameter along with that of the other terrestrial planets would be smaller than a flea (0.3 mm or 0.012 in) at this scale.[58]
Interplanetary environment
The zodiacal light, caused by interplanetary dust

The outermost layer of the Solar atmosphere is the heliosphere, which permeates much of the Solar planetary system. Along with light, the Sun radiates a continuous stream of charged particles (a plasma) called the solar wind. This stream of particles spreads outwards at speeds from 900,000 kilometres per hour (560,000 mph) to 2,880,000 kilometres per hour (1,790,000 mph),[59] filling the vacuum between the bodies of the Solar System. The result is a thin, dusty atmosphere, called the interplanetary medium, which extends to at least 100 AU (15 billion km; 9.3 billion mi). Beyond the heliosphere, large objects remain gravitationally bound to the sun, but the flow of matter in the interstellar medium homogenizes the distribution of micro-scale objects (see § Farthest regions).[60]

The interplanetary medium is home to at least two disc-like regions of cosmic dust. The first, the zodiacal dust cloud, lies in the inner Solar System and causes the zodiacal light. It may have been formed by collisions within the asteroid belt brought on by gravitational interactions with the planets; a more recent proposed origin is the planet Mars.[61] The second dust cloud extends from about 10 AU (1.5 billion km; 930 million mi) to about 40 AU (6.0 billion km; 3.7 billion mi), and was probably created by collisions within the Kuiper belt.[62][63]

Activity on the Sun's surface, such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections, disturbs the heliosphere, creating space weather and causing geomagnetic storms.[64] Coronal mass ejections and similar events blow a magnetic field and huge quantities of material from the surface of the Sun. The interaction of this magnetic field and material with Earth's magnetic field funnels charged particles into Earth's upper atmosphere, where its interactions create aurorae seen near the magnetic poles.[65] The largest stable structure within the heliosphere is the heliospheric current sheet, a spiral form created by the actions of the Sun's rotating magnetic field on the interplanetary medium.[66][67]
Life habitability
Main article: Planetary habitability in the Solar System

Besides solar energy, the primary characteristic of the Solar System enabling the presence of life is the heliosphere and planetary magnetic fields (for those planets that have them). These magnetic fields partially shield the Solar System from high-energy interstellar particles called cosmic rays. The density of cosmic rays in the interstellar medium and the strength of the Sun's magnetic field change on very long timescales, so the level of cosmic-ray penetration in the Solar System varies, though by how much is unknown.[68]

Earth's magnetic field also stops its atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind.[69] Venus and Mars do not have magnetic fields, and as a result the solar wind causes their atmospheres to gradually bleed away into space.[70]

The zone of habitability of the Solar System is conventionally located in the inner Solar System, where planetary surface or atmospheric temperatures admit the possibility of liquid water.[71] Habitability might also be possible in subsurface oceans of various outer Solar System moons.[72]
Sun
Main article: Sun
The Sun in true white color

The Sun is the Solar System's star and by far its most massive component. Its large mass (332,900 Earth masses),[73] which comprises 99.86% of all the mass in the Solar System,[74] produces temperatures and densities in its core high enough to sustain nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium.[75] This releases an enormous amount of energy, mostly radiated into space as electromagnetic radiation peaking in visible light.[76][77]

Because the Sun fuses hydrogen into helium at its core, it is a main-sequence star. More specifically, it is a G2-type main-sequence star, where the type designation refers to its effective temperature. Hotter main-sequence stars are more luminous but shorter lived. The Sun's temperature is intermediate between that of the hottest stars and that of the coolest stars. Stars brighter and hotter than the Sun are rare, whereas substantially dimmer and cooler stars, known as red dwarfs, make up about 75% of the stars in the Milky Way.[78][79]

The Sun is a population I star; it has a higher abundance of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium ("metals" in astronomical parlance) than the older population II stars.[80] Elements heavier than hydrogen and helium were formed in the cores of ancient and exploding stars, so the first generation of stars had to die before the universe could be enriched with these atoms. The oldest stars contain few metals, whereas stars born later have more. This higher metallicity is thought to have been crucial to the Sun's development of a planetary system because the planets form from the accretion of "metals".[81]
Inner Solar System
Overview of the Inner Solar System up to the Jovian System

The inner Solar System is the region comprising the terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt.[82] Composed mainly of silicates and metals,[83] the objects of the inner Solar System are relatively close to the Sun; the radius of this entire region is less than the distance between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn. This region is also within the frost line, which is a little less than 5 AU (750 million km; 460 million mi) from the Sun.[22]

Kevin: *as you approach the closet, it suddenly opens and a mummy appears, trying to grab link* oh no!
Zoe: *screams loudly and jumps back in fear, my heart racing fast. as the mummy reaches out for Link, i quickly regain my composure and take a deep breath before playing the song of healing. the mummy stops moving and after a few moments, it starts to unravel until a man appears - pamela's father*
Kevin: *nods and looks at the screen. you then see the little girl rushing towards  her father and hugging him tightly in disblief* wow, it looks like the guy turned into a mummy and the little girl had to prison him in a closet. thats majoras mask for you. *i look at your reaction*
Zoe: *watches as the scene unfolds before our eyes. my eyes widen with surprise, but also a bit of sadness. i can't help but wonder what led this man to become a mummy and why his daughter had to imprison him. the thought of his daughter having to go through this makes my eyes a little teary* yes... this game really does have its own unique atmosphere... *my voice trails off as my lips quiver just a little bit. i sigh softly and then turn back to you* okay... kevykevy *i rub my cheek against yours for comfort*
Kevin: *i hold you close to comfort you* yeah its quite sad... *i kiss your forehead and smile warmly* should we stop playing now?
Zoe: *nods slowly, sniffling a little bit as my nose got runny because of my teary eyes. i feel a bit better now that you're here with me, holding me close. my heart rate slowly returns to normal* yeah... maybe we should. i mean, this place kinda gives me the creeps now. let's just relax and watch some anime or something.
Kevin: lets cuddle a little *i nod and hold you close to me. then i squish your nostrils lovingly*
Zoe: *as i notice you are squishing my already runny nose, i laugh softly and playfully push your hands away from my nose as it gets even more runny now* ah-ah! don't do that! i'll get all snotty. *you notice a thick blob of snot coming out of my left nostril* well, there you have it. my good old snotty nose. thats all your fault! *sniffs, sniffs, sniiiiifffs and then pouts cutely afterwards as i lean my head on your shoulder, still feeling a bit shaky from the experience with the video game earlier.* well, i did a good job cleaning my nose, didn't i? it feels so damn satisfying *i giggle and point at my nose as i sniffle loudly twice in a row. you notice i have successfully cleaned my nose and there are no traces of snot left on my nostrils* thankfully my nose isn't blocked and stuffy, otherwise this would not have worked! *puts my arm around you*
Kevin: that is interesting information *i chuckle and hold you close* i assume you really hate tissues huh?
Zoe: *smirks and shrugs casually* what? they're okay, I guess. but using them is such a bother. why would i need tissues when i can just sniffle and snort my snot all up like a man?! plus, it's waaay more fun this way! *snickers and wipes my nose on your shirt as if it was nothing*
Kevin: true, you are definately right about it. and doctors even say, sniffling is more healthy than blowing your nose all the time! *i nod and hug you*
Zoe: well, well. doctor knows best, i guess. hehe. but really though, who cares what they say? i mean, it feels amazing to clear out all that nasty stuff from my sinuses and swallow it! *grins and sniffs again, producing another loud snort as i squish my nose with glee* sometimes i wish i could share this feeling with others, ya know? maybe we could start a new trend or something.
Kevin: well, people already sniffle alot when their noses start to run! the nose can get runny in a lot of scenarios after all. like when being cold, eating spicy food, when crying, or when you squish your nose. also sneezing can make the nose very runny and sometimes, snot can come out if your nose is runny and you expel air and snot as you sneeze! sneezing is basically the opposite from sniffling. sneezing makes the snot come out, sniffling makes it come back in!
Zoe: oh, yeah! i forgot about that. but you know what? sneezing doesn't bother me at all! like, at all. it's so cool! i can feel this warmth and tickle coming up my nose and then BAM! out it comes. it's like the most satisfying thing ever! and then, i just sniffle it all up and that's that. no tissues needed!
Kevin: indeed, that does feel nice xD btw, did you know there is something called the q-tip challenge? its about putting a cotton swab gently in your nose and tickle it until you start sneezing. its quite fun. we can do it someday if you want, but not today!
Zoe: ooh, that sounds interesting! definitely something i would try. we should totally do that sometime! but like you said, not today since we're already pretty chill right now. speaking of which, how are you feeling about the whole 'dating' thing? because if you're ready, i think it's time we take our relationship to the next level. what do you say?
Kevin: sure, if you want we can do that. btw, i like girls who are playful and bratty, but are very mature in situations where it counts. you definately fit that bill! so i'd say lets try it.
Zoe: yay! i'm so excited! thank you for understanding me, keviiin! i promise to be the best girlfriend ever! now let's go get some ice cream and cuddle under a blanket or something, kay?
Kevin: i have an even better idea! how about some cookies? but you can get them only if you can solve a riddle. are you up for the challenge? you have to do the riddle alone and without my help. if you achieve it, you can eat the whole box for yourself *i laugh loudly multiple times like a maniac* well then, go to the kitchen and see if you can solve it!
Q:

How to call a MainWindow method from another window?

I need to call a method from the MainWindow in another window.
Problem is i don't know why i got an error and i would like to fix it.
I tried to call the fonction using various ways, none of them worked.
Here is my last try :
What i want to call :
namespace Class1
{
    public partial class MainWindow : Window
    {
        ...
        public void SkipVideo()
        {
            ...
        }
    }
}

Here is how i tried to call :
namespace Class1
{
    public partial class TimeWindow : Window
    {
        ...
        private void DemoVideo_MediaEnded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
        {
            ((MainWindow)Application.Current.MainWindow).SkipVideo();
        }
    }
}

There is no build error, but when i run the program, it does this :
System.InvalidCastException: 'Unable to cast object of type 'Class1.TimeWindow' to type 'Class1.MainWindow'.'

A:

The InvalidCastException means that your application's mainwindow is a TimeWindow. 
Provided that there actually is a MainWindow open, you can get a reference to it like this:
private void DemoVideo_MediaEnded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    MainWindow mainWindow = Application.Current.Windows.OfType<MainWindow>().FirstOrDefault();
    if (mainWindow != null)
        mainWindow.SkipVideo();
}

There are better ways to handle this, for example using the MVVM design pattern as suggested by @Christopher, but this is probably the easiest one given your current setup.

Igor: Throwing a left hook, Igor misses Frank's jaw by just millimeters. Igor grunts, the overextension wearing on his body already. He quickly lunges forward.

Frank: Frank smirks as he sees the veteran tire so early. He bides his time, waiting for the perfect moment. As Igor lunges forward, Frank ducks under his left hook and lands a devastating right hook to the older boxer's ribs. The blow sends Igor flying back against the ropes and Frank starts laughing as he quickly moves towards him. Frank follows up with a series of rapid jabs to the chin, each one connecting with deadly precision. Igor's guard begins to falter, and Frank takes advantage, landing a crushing left hook that knocks the wind out of him. Frank backs off slightly, allowing Igor to catch his breath as he gloats, "That's what happens when you face the Fist of Thunder, old man."

def sum_list(nums): total = 0 for num in nums: total += num return total my_list = [4, 2, 7, 1, 8, 3] result = sum_list(my_list) print(result) # Output: 25 The function sum_list takes a list of integers nums as input. It initializes a variable total to 0. It then iterates through each number num in the input list nums using a for loop. For each num, it adds it to the running total variable using total += num. After the loop finishes, the final total sum is returned. In the example usage, a list my_list is defined with some sample integers. The sum_list function is called, passing my_list as the argument. The returned total sum is stored in result and then printed, which outputs 25.

In the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the University of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course prescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there, I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before I could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at Bombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and was already deep in the enemy’s country. I followed, however, with many other officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded in reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once entered upon my new duties. The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had nothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and attached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of Maiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have fallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the devotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a pack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines. Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had undergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to the base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved so far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little upon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse of our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and when at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak and emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost in sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the troopship “Orontes,” and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with my health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it. I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as air—or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will permit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to London, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of the Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at a private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless existence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely than I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that I soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate somewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in my style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making up my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less pretentious and less expensive domicile. On the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at the Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning round I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at Barts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had never been a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm, and he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In the exuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn, and we started off together in a hansom. “Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?” he asked in undisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets. “You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.” I gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it by the time that we reached our destination. “Poor devil!” he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my misfortunes. “What are you up to now?” “Looking for lodgings,” I answered. “Trying to solve the problem as to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price.” “That’s a strange thing,” remarked my companion; “you are the second man to-day that has used that expression to me.” “And who was the first?” I asked. “A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital. He was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone to go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which were too much for his purse.” “By Jove!” I cried, “if he really wants someone to share the rooms and the expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a partner to being alone.” Young Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. “You don’t know Sherlock Holmes yet,” he said; “perhaps you would not care for him as a constant companion.” “Why, what is there against him?” “Oh, I didn’t say there was anything against him. He is a little queer in his ideas—an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I know he is a decent fellow enough.” “A medical student, I suppose?” said I. “No—I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well up in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know, he has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are very desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the way knowledge which would astonish his professors.” “Did you never ask him what he was going in for?” I asked. “No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be communicative enough when the fancy seizes him.” “I should like to meet him,” I said. “If I am to lodge with anyone, I should prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong enough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in Afghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How could I meet this friend of yours?” “He is sure to be at the laboratory,” returned my companion. “He either avoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to night. If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.” “Certainly,” I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other channels. As we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford gave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to take as a fellow-lodger. “You mustn’t blame me if you don’t get on with him,” he said; “I know nothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in the laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold me responsible.” “If we don’t get on it will be easy to part company,” I answered. “It seems to me, Stamford,” I added, looking hard at my companion, “that you have some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this fellow’s temper so formidable, or what is it? Don’t be mealy-mouthed about it.” “It is not easy to express the inexpressible,” he answered with a laugh. “Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes—it approaches to cold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of the latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you understand, but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the effects. To do him justice, I think that he would take it himself with the same readiness. He appears to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge.” “Very right too.” “Yes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating the subjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking rather a bizarre shape.” “Beating the subjects!” “Yes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death. I saw him at it with my own eyes.” “And yet you say he is not a medical student?” “No. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here we are, and you must form your own impressions about him.” As he spoke, we turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door, which opened into a wing of the great hospital. It was familiar ground to me, and I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and made our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed wall and dun-coloured doors. Near the further end a low arched passage branched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory. This was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles. Broad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts, test-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames. There was only one student in the room, who was bending over a distant table absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he glanced round and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. “I’ve found it! I’ve found it,” he shouted to my companion, running towards us with a test-tube in his hand. “I have found a re-agent which is precipitated by hæmoglobin, and by nothing else.” Had he discovered a gold mine, greater delight could not have shone upon his features. “Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said Stamford, introducing us. “How are you?” he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength for which I should hardly have given him credit. “You have been in Afghanistan, I perceive.” “How on earth did you know that?” I asked in astonishment. “Never mind,” said he, chuckling to himself. “The question now is about hæmoglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine?” “It is interesting, chemically, no doubt,” I answered, “but practically——” “Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years. Don’t you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains. Come over here now!” He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his eagerness, and drew me over to the table at which he had been working. “Let us have some fresh blood,” he said, digging a long bodkin into his finger, and drawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette. “Now, I add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water. You perceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water. The proportion of blood cannot be more than one in a million. I have no doubt, however, that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction.” As he spoke, he threw into the vessel a few white crystals, and then added some drops of a transparent fluid. In an instant the contents assumed a dull mahogany colour, and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom of the glass jar. “Ha! ha!” he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a child with a new toy. “What do you think of that?” “It seems to be a very delicate test,” I remarked. “Beautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and uncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. The latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this appears to act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test been invented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who would long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes.” “Indeed!” I murmured. “Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His linen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon them. Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit stains, or what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many an expert, and why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have the Sherlock Holmes’ test, and there will no longer be any difficulty.” His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his heart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his imagination. “You are to be congratulated,” I remarked, considerably surprised at his enthusiasm. “There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would certainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there was Mason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of Montpellier, and Samson of New Orleans. I could name a score of cases in which it would have been decisive.” “You seem to be a walking calendar of crime,” said Stamford with a laugh. “You might start a paper on those lines. Call it the ‘Police News of the Past.’” “Very interesting reading it might be made, too,” remarked Sherlock Holmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger. “I have to be careful,” he continued, turning to me with a smile, “for I dabble with poisons a good deal.” He held out his hand as he spoke, and I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of plaster, and discoloured with strong acids. “We came here on business,” said Stamford, sitting down on a high three-legged stool, and pushing another one in my direction with his foot. “My friend here wants to take diggings, and as you were complaining that you could get no one to go halves with you, I thought that I had better bring you together.” Sherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with me. “I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street,” he said, “which would suit us down to the ground. You don’t mind the smell of strong tobacco, I hope?” “I always smoke ‘ship’s’ myself,” I answered. “That’s good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and occasionally do experiments. Would that annoy you?” “By no means.” “Let me see—what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps at times, and don’t open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I am sulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I’ll soon be right. What have you to confess now? It’s just as well for two fellows to know the worst of one another before they begin to live together.” I laughed at this cross-examination. “I keep a bull pup,” I said, “and I object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all sorts of ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another set of vices when I’m well, but those are the principal ones at present.” “Do you include violin-playing in your category of rows?” he asked, anxiously. “It depends on the player,” I answered. “A well-played violin is a treat for the gods—a badly-played one——” “Oh, that’s all right,” he cried, with a merry laugh. “I think we may consider the thing as settled—that is, if the rooms are agreeable to you.” “When shall we see them?” “Call for me here at noon to-morrow, and we’ll go together and settle everything,” he answered. “All right—noon exactly,” said I, shaking his hand. We left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together towards my hotel. “By the way,” I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford, “how the deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?” My companion smiled an enigmatical smile. “That’s just his little peculiarity,” he said. “A good many people have wanted to know how he finds things out.” “Oh! a mystery is it?” I cried, rubbing my hands. “This is very piquant. I am much obliged to you for bringing us together. ‘The proper study of mankind is man,’ you know.” “You must study him, then,” Stamford said, as he bade me good-bye. “You’ll find him a knotty problem, though. I’ll wager he learns more about you than you about him. Good-bye.” “Good-bye,” I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerably interested in my new acquaintance.

Joseph Amoah (sprinter)

Joseph Paul Amoah (born 12 January 1997) is a Ghanaian sprinter specializing in the 100 metres and the 200 metres. He competed at the 2019 World Athletics Championships in the 100 metres and 4 × 100 metres relay, and at the 2019 African Games he won a gold medal in the 4 × 100 metres relay. He was also a 100 metres finalist at the 2019 African Games, finishing fourth.

Amoah has personal best times of 10.01 seconds and 20.08 seconds in the 100 metres and 200 metres respectively, both set at the 2019 NCAA Division I Championships. His personal best performance in the 200 metres broke the Ghanaian record previously held by three-time Olympian Emmanuel Tuffour by 0.07 seconds.

Early life
Amoah was born on 12 January 1997 to Thomas and Alberta Amoah in Greater Accra, Ghana, and was raised by his uncle Dr. Victor Antwi from middle school onwards. His preferred sport growing up was football, but transitioned to athletics while attending Prempeh College in Kumasi where his running talent was discovered. As a 19-year old he emerged as an Olympic hopeful for Ghana in the sprints after running 100 metres in 10.08 seconds at the 2016 Ghana's Fastest Human competition.

University
After his prep career at Prempeh College, he decided to quit athletics when enrolling into Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST). However the head coach of athletics at KNUST had heard of Amoah's talent while at Prempeh college and convinced Amoah to join the team with the help of his uncle. In 2017 he transferred to Coppin State University in Baltimore, which competes in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the highest level of intercollegiate athletics in the United States.

At the 2019 Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference Championships in May, Amoah became the first Ghanaian in any sport to qualify for the 2020 Summer Olympics by running 200 metres in a personal best time in 20.20 seconds. It was the fastest performance from a Ghanaian since 1995 and also qualified him for the 2019 World Athletics Championships. Later in June of that season at the NCAA Division I Championships, he improved his personal best times in the 100 metres and 200 metres to 10.01 seconds and 20.08 seconds respectively. He broke three-time Olympian Emmanuel Tuffour's 24-year old Ghanaian record in the 200 metres (20.15 seconds, set at altitude), and qualified for the 2020 Summer Olympics in the 100 metres.

Consanguineous unions and endogamy in families of beta-thalassaemia patients from two Mediterranean populations: Tunisia and Italy.
Background: Consanguinity increases the incidence of recessive diseases such as beta-thalassaemia major (βTM), one of the most prevalent lethal inherited diseases in the world.Aim: This study aims to identify the frequency of endogamy and consanguinity in two Mediterranean βTM populations and to study the implication of socio-economic factors.Subjects and methods: A trans-sectional study was conducted in 203 Tunisian families and 75 Italian families. Data were collected using a questionnaire completed by patients and parents.Results: Complete endogamy and consanguinity were observed in 82.75% and 62.56% of Tunisian families, respectively. Complete endogamy was found in 90.67% of Italian families, no consanguinity was noted. The low occupation status of Tunisian mothers was associated with an increasing frequency of consanguinity (p = .01) and endogamy (p = .0003). Consanguinity was associated with low education level (p = .012) and low occupation status (p=.047) of fathers. No significant association was found between endogamy and socio-economic factors in the Italian sample.Conclusions: High consanguinity and endogamy rates in Tunisian families may explain the frequency of βTM in Tunisia. The high endogamy rate in Italian families could also increase the frequency of βTM. Identification of geographical distribution and socio-economic factors leading to endogamy and consanguinity in these populations might help to improve βTM prevention.
Purchasing

Violation/Penalties

Purchasing Violations:

What is a purchasing violation?
Section 31-7-57 of the MS Code states that when an employee receives goods or services without a purchase order, the agency has no liability for the bill. The employee is held personally liable.

A purchasing violation is committed when an employee receives goods or services without a purchase order

A purchasing violation is when an office prepares intentionally two or more office requisitions to the same vendor when one order combined is greater than $1,500. This is done to avoid getting written quotes/sealed bids. This is called splitting a purchase order.

A violation is when an employee personally utilizes a rebate, gift or prize given to the agency by a vendor.

PLEASE NOTE: When any employee orders or receives goods/services in the name of the Department of Education before requesting a purchase order, the employee will be held personally liable for the bill. Do not send the requisition and invoice to Accounting.

Kevin: *suddenly, the baking powder falls on top of your head covering your face well as your shirt* oh zoe! be a little more careful *i blink*

Zoe: *jumps back in surprise, knocking over an empty glass on the counter and spilling some of the ingredients* aaahhh!!! *squeals and flails around wildly, trying to get the baking powder off my face* what the heck, kev!? are you trying to blind me?! this is all your fault!! *pouting heavily, i manage to reach up and brush most of the baking powder off my face. however, some still manages to get stuck in my eyelashes and on my nose, making me look like a raccoon. as i breathe in a little through my nose, the dusty powder tickles it. i start sneezing immediately*

Kevin: my fault? i didn't do anything! *i chuckle a little and help you wipe it off.* there, that's better.

Zoe: fine. whatever, kevin. *grumbles under my breath and rub my nose with the back of my hand, still feeling a bit ticklish. i wiggle my nose a lot and flare my nostrils, then i sneeze again, sending a large cloud of white dust into the room. i sneeze several times before rolling my eyes and turning around to continue making breakfast, but not without glaring at you first* now hurry up and mix those ingredients already! the longer you take, the less time we'll have to eat our delicious pancakes!

Kevin: bless you! may that was sneezing fit wasn't it *i chuckle and mix up the ingredients*

Zoe: haha, funny. very funny. *snorts and sniffles vigorously four times in a row as my nose got extremly runny from the sneezing fit and the dust that caused it. i roll my eyes again, but can't help but smile a little despite myself. i watch you mix the ingredients carefully, humming a tune to yourself. soon enough, i pull out a griddle and start heating it up on the stove. i lean against the counter, tapping my foot impatiently and making some sounds with my mouth.*
come on, kev! aren't you forgetting something? *i tap my index finger against my chin, looking at you thoughtfully. suddenly, i smack my left hand against my forehead dramatically* duh! the batter, of course! we can't just make pancakes with air, now can we? *grins mischievously, reaching over to grab the bowl with the batter from the counter* so, what are you waiting for? let's make some pancakes already! *i clap my hands together eagerly*

Kevin: oh you are right *i giggle and get the batter too of course. soon enough, our pancakes are ready*

Zoe: yay!!! pancake time!!! *bounces excitedly on my toes and grabs a plate, ready to serve myself first. as i take the first bite of the fluffy pancake, my face lights up in delight. i close my eyes and moan softly, enjoying the taste. then, with a look of realization, i freeze mid-chew and stare at you accusingly.*
hey, kevin! these pancakes are missing something... don't you think they need syrup or something sweet on them? *pouts cutely and crosses my arms under my boobs*

Kevin: oh yeah sure. i forgot that as well. silly me! *gives you the syrup and we eat the pancakes together at the table*


Slaren: Slaren stepped into the dimly lit room, the door groaning on its hinges. The air thickened with tension as the figure moved forward, their silhouette elongated by the flickering candlelight. The black coat draped around them seemed to absorb the shadows, and the hood obscured most of their face. Only their eyes remained visible—piercing, calculating, and filled with secrets.

Karren: Karren sitting at the corner table of the jazz club, watched Slaren's entrance with a mix of anticipation and unease. She had been waiting for this clandestine meeting, the culmination of weeks of cryptic messages and veiled promises. But now that Slaren was here, the reality felt more surreal than she had imagined. The jazz band played a melancholic tune, saxophone notes weaving through the smoky air. Karen leaned forward, her voice barely audible above the music. “Slaren?” she whispered, her fingers gripping the edge of the table. “Is it really you?”

Slaren: Slaren’s nod was imperceptible, and they slid into the seat across from Karen. The candle on the table flickered, casting elongated shadows on the worn wooden surface. Their eyes locked—hers wide with curiosity, his inscrutable. The dim light revealed faint scars on Slaren’s hands, remnants of battles fought in hidden alleys and forgotten corners of the city.

Karen: “Why all the secrecy?” Karen’s question hung in the air, a fragile thread connecting them. She had risked everything for this encounter—the coded messages, the late-night rendezvous, the whispered promises of forbidden knowledge. Slaren’s presence was both exhilarating and terrifying.

Slaren: Slaren leaned back, the coat rustling softly. “Secrecy preserves power,” they murmured, their voice like the echo of distant thunder. “In this world of illusions, truth is a rare currency. We trade in secrets, Karen. Secrets that can topple empires or shatter fragile alliances.”

Karen: Karen’s pulse quickened. She had stumbled upon a hidden network—a web of spies, rebels, and those who danced on the edge of morality. Slaren was her guide, the enigmatic figure who held the key to unraveling the mysteries that plagued her sleepless nights. “Tell me,” Karen pressed, her gaze unyielding. “Why did you choose me?”

Slaren: Slaren’s lips curved into a half-smile, revealing a hint of vulnerability. “Because you see beyond the surface,” they replied. “You question the narratives, seek the hidden threads. You’re not content with the mundane. And perhaps…” They leaned closer, their breath brushing Karen’s cheek. “Perhaps you crave redemption as much as I do.”

Karen: Karen’s heart raced. Redemption—the word resonated within her, stirring memories of loss, betrayal, and the ache of unfulfilled purpose. Slaren’s eyes held a promise—a chance to rewrite her own story, to find meaning in a world that often felt indifferent. “Redemption,” Karen whispered, tasting the syllables. “But at what cost?”

Slaren: Slaren’s gaze bore into hers. “Everything has a price, Karen. Even salvation. Are you willing to pay it?”

Introduction {#s1}
============

In recent years there has been a substantial increase in the use of mass drug administration (MDA) to reduce the morbidity associated with helminth infections of humans [@pntd.0000211-Lammie1], increasing the probability that anthelmintic resistance may become a public health concern in the future. One such annual MDA programme is the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) which, in 2005, treated over 145 million people with albendazole (a broad spectrum benzimidazole anthelmintic) in combination with either ivermectin or diethylcarbamazine [@pntd.0000211-WHO1]. GPELF targets mainly *Wuchereria bancrofti*, the most widely distributed of the filarial parasites of humans.

Sensitive molecular assays are required to detect the presence of anthelmintic resistance before widespread treatment failure is apparent, drug resistance becomes disseminated and disease control is jeopardised [@pntd.0000211-Roos1]. Surveys of helminth parasites of humans are being conducted to establish whether genetic changes at certain polymorphic loci (associated with resistance to the same or related drugs used against veterinary helminths), are present in these populations and subject to detectable selection under chemotherapeutic pressure [@pntd.0000211-Albonico1]--[@pntd.0000211-Schwab1]. A phenylalanine to tyrosine substitution at position 200 on the β-tubulin isotype 1 molecule has been identified in a number of helminth parasites of farmed ruminants including *Haemonchus contortus* [@pntd.0000211-Kwa1],[@pntd.0000211-Kwa2], *Cooperia oncophora* [@pntd.0000211-Njue1], and *Teladorsagia circumcincta* [@pntd.0000211-Elard1] and is associated with benzimidazole (BZ) resistance in these species. Worryingly, this genetic change has also been identified in *W. bancrofti* [@pntd.0000211-Schwab1], though the phenotypic studies relating the substitution to a decreased albendazole efficacy have not been undertaken in this species. To aid clarity the two alleles at position 200 on the β-tubulin isotype 1 molecule shall be referred to as allele *F* (phenylalanine) for susceptibility and allele *Y* (tyrosine) for putative resistance.

Inbreeding, the mating of related individuals, influences parasite genotype distribution and can affect the selection of adaptive traits. Facets of a species\' biology may cause parasite inbreeding, such as population structure or assortative mating (when mate choice is determined by phenotype). Parasite allele frequency can differ between infrapopulations (the populations of parasites within individual hosts) due to the ecology of the infection or through the random nature of infection events (all groups may have an equal probability of having a rare allele, but actual numbers may vary between groups by chance). Helminth parasites have a particularly subdivided population structure as adult worms are confined within their definitive host, and only able to mate with other worms that belong to the same infrapopulation. The population genetic structure of most helminth species remains unknown. The few studies that have been undertaken indicate that whilst some species appear to have no apparent genetic structure others exhibit a high degree of parasite genetic differentiation between hosts [@pntd.0000211-Criscione1]. The degree of genetic differentiation in the parasite infrapopulation can shed insight into the microepidemiology of parasite transmission [@pntd.0000211-Anderson1]--[@pntd.0000211-Thron1]. Infrapopulation genetic differentiation will also influence helminth population genetics as it causes a reduction in the frequency of heterozygote offspring, a phenomenon known as the Wahlund effect [@pntd.0000211-Hartl1].

Studies investigating the inheritance of benzimidazole resistance are lacking, though evidence indicates that thiabendazole resistance in *H. contortus* may be a semi-dominant trait [@pntd.0000211-LeJambre1]. Other authors have postulated that alleles conferring anthelmintic resistance, including allele *Y*, are likely to be recessive [@pntd.0000211-Elard1],[@pntd.0000211-Prichard1], which would make heterozygote worms susceptible to treatment. If an allele conferring drug resistance is recessive, excess parasite homozygosity will increase the probability that a resistance allele will survive treatment. This has been shown using genetic metapopulation models investigating nematodes of grazing animals; these models indicate that the spread of rare recessive genes is promoted by hosts accumulating multiple related infections simultaneously [@pntd.0000211-Cornell1],[@pntd.0000211-Smith1]. The degree of parasite genetic differentiation among hosts can be quantified using *F~ST~* (or related analogues; see [@pntd.0000211-Criscione1] and references therein).

The adult stages of the majority of parasitic helminths of humans cannot be obtained routinely for direct investigation, so genetic surveys (including those investigating drug resistance) resort to sampling transmission stages, i.e. those (immature) life-stages that gain access to the environment to be transmitted to and from hosts or through vectors [@pntd.0000211-Schwab1], [@pntd.0000211-Curtis1]--[@pntd.0000211-Shrivastava1]. However, the results of these surveys should be interpreted with caution, as the underlying allele frequency of the adult worm population may differ from the allele frequency of the sampled transmission stages. Variations in transmission stage allele frequency and genotype distribution could be generated randomly or be a product of the parasite\'s spatial structure and life-history traits. For example, population subdivision will cause random variation in adult worm allele frequencies between hosts at low parasite densities. Filarial parasites have separate sexes and are thought to be polygamous [@pntd.0000211-SchulzKey1], which may accentuate the variability in microfilarial allele frequency, e.g. a rare allele may be highly over-represented in the subsequent generation if, by chance, a male worm with this allele inhabits a host harbouring females but no other males. In addition, the inherent random sampling of gametes during sexual reproduction [@pntd.0000211-Weir1], and the overdispersed distribution of parasite numbers among hosts [@pntd.0000211-Anderson2] may cause the allele frequency and genotype distribution to vary by chance from generation to generation.

This paper analyses population genetic data collected for a study by Schwab *et al.* [@pntd.0000211-Schwab1] who identified the presence of the β-tubulin allele *Y* in populations of *W. bancrofti*. Firstly, the extent of parasite inbreeding is estimated from *W. bancrofti* microfilarial samples taken from patients in Burkina Faso, West Africa. Samples were obtained from different villages, some of which had received a single round of MDA with ivermectin and albendazole, under the auspices of the GPELF. Secondly, an individual-based stochastic model is presented which simulates microfilarial genetic diversity from adult worm allele frequencies. The model generates sample allele and genotype frequencies using the same number of hosts, and the same number of microfilariae per host as in Schwab *et al.* [@pntd.0000211-Schwab1]. This model is then used to assess whether the observed level of parasite inbreeding is the result of a sampling artefact or a true biological phenomenon. Finally, the model is used to assess the likely range of adult worm allele frequencies which could have given rise to the observed microfilarial data, providing some insight into how genetic surveys which sample transmission stages should be interpreted. We discuss the implications of our results in terms of the development and detection of anthelmintic resistance.

Sampled data {#s2a}
------------

[Table 1](#pntd-0000211-t001){ref-type="table"} summarises the data collected for the study by Schwab *et al.* [@pntd.0000211-Schwab1] and indicates the number of microfilariae and hosts sampled. The village of Gora was removed from the *F*-statistic analysis since only one host was sampled in this village. In some hosts it was possible to genotype only a few microfilariae, increasing the uncertainty associated with estimation of underlying infrapopulation allele frequencies in these hosts. Results are grouped according to parasite treatment history. The average frequencies of allele *Y* in microfilarial samples from untreated and treated hosts were 0.26 and 0.60, respectively [@pntd.0000211-Schwab1]. The degree of parasite heterozygosity (the proportion of microfilariae with the heterozygote genotype) is estimated for each village. The table also indicates the deviation of each population from the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), which gives the proportion of heterozygote microfilariae that would be expected in a randomly mating population. This reveals a strong deficit of heterozygotes in all three populations.

Results were presented by Schwab *et al.* [@pntd.0000211-Schwab1]. The range of microfilarial samples obtained per host is given in brackets. The expected microfilariae heterozygosity according to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is given in square brackets.

In this paper, we refer to two different types of allele frequency: (1) the underlying frequency of the allele putatively associated with BZ resistance, with *q^l^* denoting the allele frequency of the entire parasite population of a given locality, and (2) the parasite allele frequency within the host population that is sampled, denoted by *^H^q^l^*. The superscript *l* denotes the parasite life-stage under investigation, be it microfilariae (*l = M*) or adult worms (*l = W*), and *H* denotes definitive host. The allele frequency estimated from the sample, , may not correspond to the true underlying allele frequency, *q^l^*, either because the hosts sampled are not representative of the whole host population, or because the parasites genotyped do not represent adequately the allele frequency within the host.

Estimating parasite inbreeding {#s2b}
------------------------------

By genotyping transmission stages before they leave the definitive host prior to the introduction of mass chemotherapy, insight can be gained into the different causes of microfilarial excess homozygosity. If it is assumed that the number of microfilariae produced, their survival, and their probability of being sampled are independent of their genotype (as we do in the null model), it can be assumed that deviation from the HWE may be the result of non-random mating. If the locus being investigated is not under selection, the excess microfilarial homozygosity will most likely be the result of either infrapopulation genetic differentiation or non-random parasite mating within hosts. Genotyping transmission stages would allow the relative contributions of each of these two sources of inbreeding to be estimated. The variation in the allele frequency between hosts will account for some of the excess homozygosity whilst deviation from the HWE in the microfilariae within an individual host will indicate possible non-random mating within the infrapopulation.

The Wright\'s hierarchical *F*-statistic is used to investigate the correlation of parasite genes within and between human hosts [@pntd.0000211-Curtis1]--[@pntd.0000211-Paterson1],[@pntd.0000211-Brouwer1]. It is assumed that the infrapopulation is the first hierarchical group in the parasite population, and *F~IS~* is defined as the correlation of genes between microfilariae within the infrapopulation; , as the correlation of microfilarial genes between different hosts living in the same village; , as the correlation of microfilarial genes between different villages within the overall microfilarial population; and *F~IT~*, as the correlation of genes between individual microfilariae relative to the overall microfilarial population of the region. The different inbreeding terms introduced are summarized in [Table 2](#pntd-0000211-t002){ref-type="table"}. A value of *F~IS~* is significantly greater than zero points towards adult worm non-random mating, indicates variation in worm allele frequency between hosts, and suggests differences in the worm allele frequency between villages. The same statistical frameworks used to estimate Wright\'s *F*-statistic were employed here, taking into account variable sample sizes [@pntd.0000211-Weir1]. Estimates of the 95% confidence intervals for *F~IS~*, and *F~IT~*, were generated by bootstrapping simultaneously worms within each host and bootstrapping over hosts within each village [@pntd.0000211-Efron1]. *F-*statistics, and their associated uncertainty, were calculated for each village.

Modelling the allele frequency and genotype distribution of microfilariae {#s2c}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

A dioecious adult worm helminth population with a 1:1 male to female ratio was randomly generated for a given mean number of worms per host and degree of parasite overdispersion (as determined by the *k* parameter of the negative binomial distribution, parameterized following [@pntd.0000211-Anderson2]). Each adult worm infrapopulation was randomly allocated an allele frequency, as analysis of pre-treatment data did not detect any significant relationship between the host\'s frequency of allele *Y* and microfilarial burden. The adult worm allele frequency of each host was randomly selected according to the given underlying allele frequency, *q^W^*, and the degree of parasite genetic differentiation between hosts, . For a description of a method for generating the distribution of allele frequencies in a subdivided population using the beta distribution [@pntd.0000211-Wright1], see Porter [@pntd.0000211-Porter1].

It is again assumed that microfilarial production and survival is independent of genotype, allowing a microfilarial population for each host *i* to be generated according to the size and allele frequency of the adult worm infrapopulation. Worms were assumed to be polygamous; implying that if only one male parasite were present within a host, all fertile females within that infrapopulation would be mated. The number of microfilariae produced by each parasite infrapopulation was assumed to be proportional to the number of fertilised females within that host. It was also assumed that gametes separate independently and re-assort according to the degree of non-random mating (*F~IS~*). The probability with which a microfilaria within host *i*, will be of genotype *j* is denoted , and given by the equations, where and are, respectively, the frequency of allele *Y* in the male and female adult worms within host *i*, and and are the corresponding susceptible allele *F* frequencies. To allow random stochastic fluctuations in genotype distribution, the actual number of microfilariae in host *i* with genotype *j* follows a binomial distribution, with the number of trials being equal to the number of microfilariae produced by host *i*, with genotype probability equal to .

Microfilarial allele frequencies and genotype distributions were generated by sampling a specific number of microfilariae from the generated hypothetical population according to the sampling scheme used in Schwab *et al.* [@pntd.0000211-Schwab1]. The exact number of samples taken from each of the 30 hosts was: 11, 10, 15, 9, 11, 9, 13, 10, 10, 7, 10, 10, 7, 1, 11, 9, 1, 7, 4, 1, 10, 9, 8, 6, 4, 6, 9, 10, 10, 8, for a total of 246 microfilariae. Analysis of pre-treatment data had indicated that the number of samples taken from each host by Schwab *et al.* [@pntd.0000211-Schwab1] was independent of host microfilaraemia and host allele frequency, allowing the number of microfilariae sampled per host to be randomly allocated. The program code for the simulations implemented was written in C++ and run 100,000 times, with each run generating a new helminth population and genotype distribution from which 95% confidence limits (95% CL) were calculated.

The model was parameterised for the untreated villages of Tangonko and Badongo, Burkina Faso, which had an initial prevalence of microfilaraemia of 25%. The mean adult worm burden was estimated from observed microfilarial counts using the functional relationship given in the deterministic model EPIFIL (see original formulation and parameter values in Norman *et al*. [@pntd.0000211-Norman1]), giving a mean adult worm burden of 13.5 host^−1^. The degree of adult worm overdispersion was estimated from the recorded microfilarial prevalence (taken here as a proxy for the prevalence of adult worms producing microfilariae) and the mean adult worm burden, using the prevalence vs. intensity relationship that derives from assuming a negative binomial distribution of worms among hosts [@pntd.0000211-Anderson2], yielding a *k* value of 0.07. The model outlined above will only be valid for comparisons against the pre-treatment data, since chemotherapy is known to impede microfilarial production and / or survival [@pntd.0000211-Tisch1].

The null model assumes that mating is random between male and female worms within each infrapopulation and that allele *Y* is randomly distributed across hosts, i.e. . Results of the inbreeding analysis can be incorporated into the individual-based model described in equations (1) to (3) to explore the range of adult worm allele frequencies which can give rise to the observed microfilarial data.

Results {#s3}
=======

The observed microfilarial genotype distribution was found to deviate from HWE. Villages with no history of mass anthelmintic chemotherapy had an overall inbreeding coefficient of *F~IT~* = 0.44 (95% CL = 0.17, 0.68), indicating strong inbreeding. Fifteen percent of the microfilariae were found to be homozygous for allele *Y*, an estimate 2.3 times higher than would be expected in a random mating parasite population. Results indicate the occurrence of a significant degree of genetic differentiation in worm allele frequency among the host population . Infrapopulation allele *Y* frequency, , varied from 0 to 0.77 in the villages with no history of treatment, indicating an increase in microfilarial homozygosity of 60% above HWE. The results also suggest a degree of non-random mating within hosts measured by *F~IS~* = 0.29 (−0.09, 0.54), which is however is not significantly greater than zero. No difference was observed in the microfilarial allele frequency between the two treatment-naïve villages .

The data from the two treatment-naïve villages of Tangonko and Badongo were analysed separately. Both showed a high level of microfilarial homozygosity, with overall inbreeding coefficient of *F~IT~* = 0.51 (0.16, 0.76) and *F~IT~* = 0.33 (−0.10, 0.78), respectively ([Figure 1](#pntd-0000211-g001){ref-type="fig"}). The degree of parasite genetic differentiation between hosts varied between the two villages, though the difference was not statistically significant (*p* = 0.38, calculated from the square of the normalized difference in *F~ST~* estimates [@pntd.0000211-Little1]). For the purpose of the following analysis the two treatment-naïve villages have been grouped together to increase the study sample size. A similar degree of parasite inbreeding was observed in the village of Perigban which had received one round of MDA.

The error bars are the 95% confidence intervals. *F~IT~* estimates the total degree of parasite inbreeding; *F~IS~* describes the level of non-random mating within the infrapopulation; and shows the variation in microfilarial allele frequency within the host subpopulation (village).](pntd.0000211.g001){#pntd-0000211-g001}

Parasite inbreeding increases the range of underlying adult worm allele *Y* frequencies, *q^W^*, which can give rise to the observed microfilarial allele *Y* frequency of 0.26 ([Figure 2](#pntd-0000211-g002){ref-type="fig"}). Results from the null model, where mating was assumed to be random and allele *Y* is randomly distributed amongst hosts, indicate that *q^W^* in the untreated villages of Tangonko and Badongo could range from 0.21 to 0.32. If we use the excess inbreeding estimate reported in pre-treatment villages (*F~IT~* = 0.44), then model simulations suggest that *q^W^* could range from 0.18 to 0.37.

The microfilarial genotype diversity model indicates that the observed homozygosity is unlikely to be solely a result of genetic sampling, demographic stochasticity, population subdivision, or the sampling scheme employed, suggesting that true biological mechanisms are operating in the parasite population even before the introduction of anthelmintic therapy. [Figure 2](#pntd-0000211-g002){ref-type="fig"} indicates the range of likely microfilarial genotype distributions that can be generated from a given *q^W^* value using the null (random) model. The observed excess homozygosity in the untreated villages was greater than the 95% confidence interval estimates generated by the null model ([Figure 3](#pntd-0000211-g003){ref-type="fig"}). It is interesting to note the wide range of microfilarial genotype distributions that can be generated by the null model.

The black diamond represents the value originating from the observed data (with , and *F~IT~* = 0.44), and the error bars indicate the uncertainty in genotype distribution stemming from the values of *q^W^* (0.21, 0.32) that were estimated from the null (random) model ([Figure 2](#pntd-0000211-g002){ref-type="fig"}).

The solid-black curve represents the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). The null model generating microfilarial allele frequencies (see text) was used to investigate the range of sample microfilarial genotype distributions that could be obtained from a population exhibiting no excess inbreeding (i.e. assuming that the underlying adult parasite population would have values of ). Simulations mimic the same sampling scheme described in Schwab *et al*. The observed microfilarial genotype distribution falls outside the 95% confidence interval range (grey shaded area surrounding the HWE curve) generated by the null model, despite the uncertainty in the underlying *q^W^* estimates, indicating strong parasite inbreeding even before introduction of antifilarial combination therapy.](pntd.0000211.g003){#pntd-0000211-g003}

Despite the large increase in microfilarial homozygosity attributable to parasite inbreeding, there is only a modest increase in the prevalence of hosts who have microfilariae that are homozygous for allele *Y* (and therefore putatively resistant if the allele confers drug resistance were recessive, [Figure 4](#pntd-0000211-g004){ref-type="fig"}). Parasite overdispersion reduces the number of hosts who are microfilaria-positive and concentrates allele *Y* into a small proportion of the host population. A high degree of parasite non-random mating and infrapopulation genetic differentiation increases the number of hosts (and the number of samples per host) that need to be sampled, in order to detect or quantify reliably parasite genetic diversity ([Figure 4](#pntd-0000211-g004){ref-type="fig"}). The model is used to investigate how parasite inbreeding may influence the sampling scheme of genetic surveys seeking to identify the presence of a known marker for drug resistance ([Figure 5](#pntd-0000211-g005){ref-type="fig"}). Results indicate that the observed level of parasite inbreeding markedly increases the minimum number of hosts, and the overall number of samples necessary to be 95% confident of detecting a rare allele. The sampling scheme used within [Figure 5](#pntd-0000211-g005){ref-type="fig"} assumes that the number of parasites genotyped per host is weighted by the host\'s microfilarial load. This improves the accuracy of allele frequency estimates by allowing heavily infected hosts to have a greater contribution to the sampled microfilarial population, something which is particularly important in overdispersed parasite populations.

To date there is no phenotypic evidence that allele *Y* causes albendazole resistance in *W. bancrofti*. However, if an allele conferring drug resistance existed in populations of this parasite then the consequences on the spread of such an allele of parasite non-random mating and genetic differentiation between hosts will depend on the frequency and the relative dominance of the resistance allele. If the resistance allele were recessive, helminth inbreeding would greatly increase the probability that a parasite survives anthelmintic treatment. This is evident from [Figure 6](#pntd-0000211-g006){ref-type="fig"} which shows the influence of parasite inbreeding on the relative proportion of resistant genotypes for a given allele frequency. With a recessive resistance allele at a frequency of 0.05, the degree of inbreeding within the *W. bancrofti* population reported here, would on average increase the number of worms with the homozygote resistance genotype nine-fold. Conversely, if the resistance allele was dominant, inbreeding would reduce the probability that a parasite survives chemotherapy, as fewer worms would have the resistant allele (the deficiency of heterozygous parasites caused by parasite inbreeding will be greater than the increase in resistant homozygous worms).

Discussion {#s4}
==========

The genotype distribution of *W. bancrofti* microfilariae varied dramatically from the HWE prior to the introduction of MDA. The degree of excess homozygosity reported falls outside the range of values generated by the null model described in this paper, indicating a significant degree of parasite non-random mating. This may be caused, in part, by parasite genetic differentiation between hosts. The null model generates a wide range of microfilarial allele frequencies and genotype distributions indicating that caution should be exercised when interpreting results obtained by sampling solely transmission stages. Significant changes in the genetic diversity of microfilarial populations over time may not reflect a significant change in the underlying adult worm population. This result highlights the crucial importance of developing sound theoretical null models that enable helminth population genetics data to be interpreted adequately [@pntd.0000211-Prugnolle2]. These models should take into account the uncertainty in outcomes, given the sampling scheme employed and the life-history traits of the parasite. A combination of sampling transmission stages and parasite inbreeding could cause estimates of the underlying adult worm allele frequency to be highly variable, increasing the number of samples that need to be genotyped in order to detect significant changes in the adult worm genome with time after introduction of chemotherapeutic pressure.

Producing a null model to assess the range of adult worm allele frequencies that could give rise to the microfilarial genetic diversity observed in villages having received treatment is complex and beyond the scope of this paper. A dynamic, full transmission model would be required that takes into account the pharmacodynamic properties of the drugs in combination and separately, as the effects of chemotherapy will influence microfilarial genetic diversity for a number of years after chemotherapy. As a result it is not possible to conclude whether adult worm genetic diversity differs between the villages that have and have not received MDA, even though their microfilarial populations differ significantly in their genetic diversity.

The results presented within this paper regarding the metapopulation dynamics of bancroftian filariasis stem from the analysis of a single nucleotide polymorphism in one gene. Further surveys, using multiple neutral polymorphic loci, are required to distinguish demographic and sampling effects from selective pressures [@pntd.0000211-Weir1]. If the allele of interest has been under selection then the observed genotype distribution could have been generated without the need for non-random parasite mating. The accuracy of the model developed here to derive microfilarial genetic diversity is limited by uncertainties regarding the biology of *W. bancrofti*. Results are dependent on our current ability to mimic adult worm burden and its distribution among hosts. Limitations inherent in the EPIFIL model, the presence of amicrofilaraemic yet circulating filarial antigen-positive infections, and possible heterogeneity in host immune responses could make adult worm burden estimates highly uncertain from microfilarial prevalence and intensity data. The relationship between the number of adult filariae and the rate of microfilarial production is likely to be complex and may depend on the immune responses elicited during the infection. The null model assumes a mean parasite intensity of 13.5 adult worms per host, though sensitivity analysis indicated that model results were relatively insensitive to small changes in parasite intensity around this value (sensitivity analysis ranged from 8.5 to 18.5 adult worms host^−1^, results not shown). Our conclusions are based on the adequacy of the null model, which may be improved by the inclusion of further biological detail. For example, recent evidence suggests a possible association between β-tubulin genotype in the related filarial parasite, *Onchocerca volvulus*, and female worm fertility [@pntd.0000211-Bourguinat1],[@pntd.0000211-Bourguinat2], suggesting a cost of resistance. Whilst the same gene has been analyzed in the current study, it is not known whether a similar relationship between genotype and fertility applies to *W. bancrofti*. If this were the case then the conclusions drawn regarding the causes of the observed genotype distribution should be treated with caution. Although no differences were seen in genotype frequency between the two pre-treatment villages studied, additional baseline surveys (prior to the start of MDA) would be required before firm conclusions regarding the true underlying frequency of allele *Y* in pre-treatment *W. bancrofti* populations can be drawn.

Notwithstanding the fact that the *F*-statistic provides a phenomenological tool rather than a mechanistic measure of inbreeding (and therefore does not describe the biological processes generating excess homozygosity), we proceed to propose some likely causes for the strong degree of non-random mating identified in *W. bancrofti*, as well as the implications that this may have for the development and detection of anthelmintic resistance.

Non-random infrapopulation mating {#s4a}
---------------------------------

Our results suggest that adult *W. bancrofti* worms do not mate randomly within the infrapopulation. This is in agreement with ultrasonography studies that show adult parasites congregating in 'worm nests' along lymphatic vessels, which remain stable over time [@pntd.0000211-Dreyer1]. Spatial heterogeneity within the host may produce multiple reproducing populations within each infrapopulation, which would increase host microfilarial homozygosity. Evidence of an apparent relationship between β-tubulin genotype, the same gene analyzed by Schwab *et al.* [@pntd.0000211-Schwab1], and female worm fertility in the related filaria *O. volvulus* has been reported by Bourguinat *et al.* [@pntd.0000211-Bourguinat2]. If such a relationship exists in *W. bancrofti*, the excess within-host homozygosity reported above may result from the increased fertility of homozygous adult worms. Anthelmintic treatment, prior to the introduction of MDA for lymphatic filariasis, may also have increased non-random mating depending on the selective advantage that allele *Y* may confer to the parasite at the time of treatment.

Parasite genetic differentiation between hosts {#s4b}
----------------------------------------------

The degree of genetic differentiation in the parasite infrapopulation can shed insight into the microepidemiology of parasite transmission [@pntd.0000211-Anderson1]--[@pntd.0000211-Thron1]. The metapopulation transmission dynamics of *W. bancrofti* will depend on the transmission efficiency and biting behaviour of the mosquito vector. *Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto* and *An. funestus* are thought to be the main vectors of *W. bancrofti* in Burkina Faso [@pntd.0000211-Gyapong1]. Hosts can acquire multiple L3 larvae during the same bite. Although density-dependent processes are known to operate on the uptake and development of *W. bancrofti* in *An. gambiae*, infective vectors will regularly transmit multiple related L3 larvae simultaneously [@pntd.0000211-Snow1]. Other mosquito vectors of *W. bancrofti* have even greater vector competence. For example, up to 32 L3 larvae were recovered from an experimental host after it was bitten by a single *Culex quinquefasciatus* [@pntd.0000211-Gasarasi1], a main vector in East Africa. Mark-recapture studies and bloodmeal analysis indicate that various mosquito species appear to have high site fidelity, regularly biting multiple members of the same household [@pntd.0000211-McCall1],[@pntd.0000211-Michael1]. These aspects of *W. bancrofti* transmission increase the likelihood that a host will be infected with closely related parasites and will contribute to the observed genetic differentiation.

More generally, drug treatment may increase infrapopulation genetic heterogeneity, as those parasites within treated hosts which survive treatment may have a higher resistance allele frequency than those harboured within untreated hosts. In Burkina Faso, lymphatic filariasis is treated with albendazole and ivermectin. Evidence indicates that the albendazole plus ivermectin combination has some macrofilaricidal and reproductive effects (mainly associated with albendazole [@pntd.0000211-Tisch1]), as well as the microfilaricidal effect (mainly associated with ivermectin). It is possible that a degree of the genetic differentiation between hosts observed in the untreated villages may have resulted from individual members of the community seeking, for instance, treatment for geohelminth infection prior to the introduction of GPELF.

The spread of anthelmintic resistance {#s4c}
-------------------------------------

Population subdivision and non-random mating will influence the outcomes of selection under chemotherapeutic pressure in different ways, depending on the initial frequency of the allele under selection and the ecology of the infection. Before the rate of spread of drug resistant parasites can be predicted reliably and accurately, greater knowledge would be required regarding the number, linkage, dominance, and possible negative pleiotropic effects of putative resistance allele(s), as well as regarding the pharmacodynamic properties of the drugs administered singly and in combination. However, useful biological insights can be obtained from mathematical models that make reasonable assumptions concerning the above [@pntd.0000211-Schwab2],[@pntd.0000211-Schwab3].

If the resistance allele is recessive and it has a low initial frequency, inbreeding will increase parasite homozygosity and as a result, the spread of drug resistant worms across the parasite population (see [Figure 6](#pntd-0000211-g006){ref-type="fig"} and [@pntd.0000211-Schwab2]). If drug resistance is a semi-dominant trait then parasite inbreeding will either increase or decrease the spread of drug resistance, depending on the efficacy of the drug against heterozygote parasites. Parasite genetic differentiation between hosts will also increase the spread of resistance even when the resistance allele is initially present at a very low frequency, as it increases the probability that male and female resistant worms will inhabit the same infrapopulation. This work is consistent with mathematical models of veterinary helminths which indicate that spatial heterogeneity and aggregated infections between hosts increase the spread of rare recessive genes [@pntd.0000211-Cornell1],[@pntd.0000211-Smith1].

The detection of anthelmintic resistance {#s4d}
----------------------------------------

The operation of a strong degree of parasite genetic differentiation between hosts reduces the prevalence of infection with drug resistant parasites and would therefore increase the number of hosts and parasites that should be sampled to detect and quantify the frequency of resistance-conferring alleles reliably. Even at high resistance allele frequencies, some hosts will have no phenotypic signs of resistance, particularly if the resistance allele is recessive, and therefore hosts respond to treatment. In practice the number of parasites that can be genotyped will be restricted, so surveys should carefully consider the sampling scheme they employ in order to maximise the accuracy of allele frequency estimates. Repeatedly sampling from the same host increases the chance of detecting a resistance mutation if it is present in that infrapopulation. However, sampling transmission stages from as many hosts as possible should be considered the optimum strategy, even in a population with low parasite genetic differentiation between hosts, as it reduces the chance of repeatedly sampling offspring of the same adult worm. Prior to the introduction of chemotherapy, studies investigating the presence and frequency of putative resistance markers through genotyping transmission stages alone should weight the number of samples they take per host by the host\'s infection intensity. However, after the start of chemotherapy the best sampling scheme will depend on the pharmacodynamics of the drug and the nature of the questions under investigation.

Parasite elimination {#s4e}
--------------------

For human helminth infections, the importance of parasite genetic differentiation between hosts stretches beyond population genetics and will influence the outcomes of parasite elimination campaigns such as the GPELF. The ability of a parasite species to persist in a host population following prolonged MDA will depend in part on the metapopulation dynamics of helminth transmission, the patterns of host compliance with treatment regimes and the pharmacodynamic properties of the drugs used. The aggregated nature of the passage of transmission stages between hosts will make parasite elimination harder to achieve by lowering the breakpoint density (the unstable equilibrium below which the parasite population will tend naturally to local extinction [@pntd.0000211-Macdonald1]), as overdispersion of parasites will result in fewer hosts with a single-sexed infection.

Natural killer cell cytotoxicity and alpha-interferon in early rheumatoid arthritis.
Natural killer (NK) cell number, cytotoxicity, and serum alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN) was measured in a group of early synovitis patients and compared to that of established rheumatoid arthritis patients and normal controls. No significant differences in NK cell number or serum alpha-IFN were found. NK cell cytotoxicity (NKCC) in the early synovitis group was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced compared to that of the normal controls and not significantly different from the established rheumatoid controls. There was a trend for those early synovitis patients with a good outcome to have higher NKCC. Low NKCC is evident very early in the course of rheumatoid arthritis and is thus unlikely to be secondary to chronic inflammation. There is no relationship between NKCC and alpha-IFN levels and the cause of the reduced NKCC is unknown. Alpha-IFN levels are not raised early in the course of RA.
France Clear Favorite on 2022 World Cup Odds

The 2018 FIFA World Cup came to a conclusion on Sunday as France posted a 4-2 victory over Croatia to claim their second World Cup title in 20 years and pay out on +700 pre-tournament World Cup championship odds.

Sunday’s victory as +110 favorites on the World Cup game line odds continues France’s torrid play at recent international tournaments. Les Bleus came within an extra time goal of the Euro 2016 championship, falling to Portugal by a 1-0 score in their only defeat at a major international tournament since the quarter-finals of the 2014 World Cup.

With a youthful lineup led by 19-year-old Kylian Mbappe, who garnered Best Young Player Award honors at this year’s tournament, France’s future looks bright. Fresh off the heels of their victory this weekend, Les Bleus opened as clear +500 favorites to successfully defend their title on the 2022 World Cup odds.

While Sunday’s loss as +300 underdogs proved to be a massive disappointment for Croatia, the Blazers’ impressive drive to their first-ever berth in a World Cup final has earned them hard-fought status as one of the world’s elite squads. However, Croatia’s heroics at Russia 2018 have done little to boost them on the early 2022 World Cup betting lines, where they lag well behind the favorites as a +5000 wager.

A trio of squads coming off disappointing performances at this year’s tournament closely follow Les Bleus on the 2022 World Cup championship odds, with Brazil pegged at +700, ahead of Spain at +750, while 2014 title holders Germany sit at +800.

The Canarinho traveled to Russia as +400 pre-tournament favorites on the 2018 World Cup odds, and looked poised for a deep knockout stage run after closing out the group stage with a pair of clean-sheet wins. However, Brazil was unable to solve a high-powered Belgium squad in a 2-1 loss that marked their third quarter-final exit in their past four tournament appearances.

Spain made a second straight early exit at this year’s tournament, falling to Russia on penalties in a Round of 16 match, which marks their only knockout stage appearance since raising the hardware at the 2010 World Cup.

Russia 2018 also proved to be a bitter disappointment for Germany, who closely followed Brazil at +475 on the World Cup futures entering the tournament. However, a shocking 1-0 group stage loss to Mexico as heavy -210 favorites set the tone for Die Mannschaft’s shortest run at a World Cup since 1938.

Belgium Trails on 2022 World Cup Betting Lines

Further down the 2022 World Cup odds, Belgium sits at +1100, followed by Argentina at +1200, and Italy at +1800, while England joins the Netherlands at +2000.

Les Diables Rouges led all squads with 16 goals at Russia 2018, and saw a 25-match unbeaten streak come to an end with a 1-0 loss to France in the semi-finals. Argentina posted just one win in four matches at this year’s tournament, and maintains strong odds despite the uncertain future of superstar Lionel Messi, while Italy and the Netherlands face daunting rebuilding tasks after both European powerhouses failed to qualify for this year’s tournament.

Conversely, England sports a youthful roster, led by top goalscorer Harry Kane, which is likely to make the Three Lions a serious contender at Qatar 2022.

Karen: Karen sat at the dimly lit café, her fingers tapping nervously on the chipped coffee cup. She had been waiting for Slaren, her mysterious online pen pal, for weeks. Their conversations had been cryptic, filled with riddles and secrets. She wondered if Slaren would show up this time or vanish like a ghost.

Slaren: The door creaked open, and a tall figure stepped inside. Slaren wore a long black coat, the hood pulled low over their face. Their eyes, however, glinted with curiosity as they scanned the room. Karen’s heart raced. Was this Slaren? She couldn’t be sure.

Karen: “Slaren?” Karen whispered, her voice barely audible over the jazz music playing in the background. Slaren nodded, sliding into the seat across from her. Their eyes locked, and Karen felt a strange mix of fear and excitement. “Why all the secrecy?”

Slaren: Slaren leaned in, their breath brushing Karen’s cheek. “Because some secrets are dangerous, Karen. You stumbled upon something you shouldn’t have.” They slid a folded piece of paper across the table. “Read it.”

Karen: Karen unfolded the paper. It was a map, dotted with cryptic symbols. “What is this?”

Slaren: “The path to the Lost Library,” Slaren said. “A place where forbidden knowledge lies. But beware, Karen. The library guards its secrets fiercely.”

Karen: Karen’s pulse quickened. “Why are you telling me this?”

Slaren: “Because you’re the Chosen One,” Slaren replied. “Only you can decipher the symbols and unlock the library’s door. But there’s a price.”

Karen: “What price?” Karen asked, her mind racing. She had always been drawn to mysteries, but this was beyond anything she’d imagined.

Slaren: Slaren’s eyes darkened. “Your memories. The library takes them as payment. Everything you hold dear—forgotten.”

Karen: Karen hesitated. Memories of her childhood, her first love, her grandmother’s stories—all gone? But the lure of forbidden knowledge tugged at her. “What’s inside?”

Slaren: “Answers,” Slaren said. “Answers to questions you’ve never dared ask. The truth about the universe, the purpose of existence, and the key to immortality.”

Karen: Karen glanced at the map. “And if I refuse?”

Slaren: Slaren leaned even closer. “Then the world remains in darkness. The balance tips, and chaos reigns.”

Karen: Karen’s mind raced. Could she sacrifice her memories for the greater good? She looked at Slaren, their eyes filled with both sorrow and hope. “Fine. I’ll do it.”

Slaren: Slaren smiled, revealing sharp teeth. “Brave choice, Karen. Meet me at the crossroads tonight. We’ll begin the journey.”

Q:

What does "schnäuzen" mean? And "schniefen"?

A:

"Schnäuzen" is German and means nose blowing. "Schniefen" on the other hand means to sniffle. Sniffling and nose blowing are polar opposites. Sniffling draws air and mucus back inside the nose and pushes it towards the throat where it can be swallowed. Nose blowing expels mucus towards the outside and makes it visible on the nostrils or tissues.

اندلعت حرب بين الطيور والوحوش بعد أن عانى الإوز من الاضطهاد على يد الثعالب، وقام النسر والبومة باصطياد الأرنب والفئران. كانت المعركة كارثية، حيث ماتت العديد من المخلوقات. انحازت الخفافيش، وهي عرق سياسي للغاية، في البداية إلى جانب الطيور، ولكن عندما بدأت الوحوش في اكتساب الأرض، غيروا مواقفهم. كان كلا الجانبين غاضبين من خداع الخفافيش واتفقا على قضية مشتركة لطردهم. ونتيجة لذلك، يختبئ الخفافيش الآن في الأبراج المظلمة والأطلال، ولا يخرجون إلا في الليل، مما يثبت أن المخادعين ليس لديهم أصدقاء.
السيد سكالبر هو محدد الشخصية في صحيفة تسمى The Daily Eclipse. في وقت متأخر من الليل، يكون بمفرده في غرفة المراسلين ويتنقل ذهابًا وإيابًا بين كتابة تحليلات شخصية المشتركين الذين أرسلوا عينات من الكتابة اليدوية والشرب من زجاجة خمور سوداء طويلة لتحفيز ذكائه. في الخارج، يقوم شرطي بدوريات في الشارع، وهو يندب الوحدة التي يعاني منها في وظيفته ويكتب في دفتر ملاحظاته على ضوء مصباح الغاز. يلاحظ الشرطي شخصًا مشبوهًا وشخصًا صينيًا يعود إلى المنزل متأخرًا من العمل. يشعر الشرطي بالإلهام من وجود السيد سكالبر، فيكتب مونولوجًا شعريًا في دفتر ملاحظاته. يقوم السيد سكالبر بدوره بتشجيع الشرطي من خلال تناول مشروب له. تستفيد كلتا الشخصيتين من لحظة مشتركة من التواصل الإنساني وتتأملان في العزاء الذي تجلبه تجارتهما.
بعد تلقي رسالة من أحد المراسلين والتي قرأها بارتياح، قرر السيد سكالبر أن يكتب رسالة خاصة منفصلة إلى امرأة تدعى العمة دوروثيا بالإضافة إلى نسخة مطبوعة من الرسالة التي تلقاها. يقاطع الشرطي هوجان هذه العملية لكتابة سجل الأحداث الخاص به، مما دفع السيد سكالبر إلى خفض الزجاجة التي كان يستخدمها لمساعدته في الكتابة. لمنح هوجان نفس الفرصة، قرر السيد سكالبر عدم سحب الزجاجة على الفور وحاول كتابة شخصية أخرى. عند قراءة الرسالة المقابلة، يبدو أن السيد سكالبر متأثر بشكل واضح ويقرر سحب الزجاجة قبل أن يتمكن هوجان من تذوق المشروب الكحولي. ومع ذلك، فإن جهوده لم تنجح حيث نام هوجان بينما كان لا يزال ممسكًا بالزجاجة، وبدلاً من ذلك عاد السيد سكالبر لإنهاء مهمته. بعد ملء العمود بشخصية خيالية، يرتدي السيد سكالبر قبعته ومعطفه ويعود إلى المنزل وهو يشعر بالرضا عن راتبه.
بعد إصراره على رغبته في الزواج من ميرتل، حصل جوس على الإذن بإخراجها بشرط أن يتصرف على طبيعته. بدأ على الفور في اتخاذ خطوات للاقتراب منها، واقترب في النهاية بما يكفي ليمسك بيدها ويخبرها بثروتها في غضون ثماني دقائق. طالب فريد ويوستاس بتقديم الموسيقى لموعدهما، وعندما انتهى بالخارج، طلب مقطوعة أخرى واختارت ميرتل واحدة. إن رؤيته قريبة جدًا من ميرتل جعلتهم غاضبين لذا غادر فريد ويوستاس دون أن يقولوا وداعًا. في النهاية، أكسب إصراره عاطفة ميرتل، وتزوجا من فريد ويوستاس كمرشدين. في نهاية المطاف، الرسالة هي أنه للحصول على محاكمة عادلة، فأنت بحاجة إلى جهاز تنظيم ضربات القلب.
على الرغم من حجمه وقوته، لم يتمكن النسر من حماية بيضه من خنفساء لا هوادة فيها. وبعد عدة محاولات من النسر لحماية البيض، تكشف الخنفساء سبب عزمها على ذلك. يقر كوكب المشتري بسبب الخنفساء، وبسبب الموقف، يأمر بحماية الخنفساء ومنحها مكانًا آمنًا للنوم. هذه القصة بمثابة تذكير بأنه حتى الأصغر والأضعف يمكنهم إيجاد طريقة للانتقام عندما يتعرضون للظلم.
عقدت الفئران اجتماعًا لوضع خطة للهروب من عدوهم القط. لقد نظروا في العديد من الأفكار ولكن لم يتم اعتبار أي منها مناسبًا. بعد ذلك، اقترح فأر صغير أن يتم وضع جرس حول رقبة القطة، بحيث عندما يُسمع رنينه، ستعرف الفئران أنها تهرب. كان الجميع سعداء بهذه الخطة، لكن الصعوبة كانت تكمن في من سيضع الجرس على القطة في المقام الأول. في نهاية المطاف، اقتراح الخطة وتنفيذها أمران مختلفان تمامًا.
على مدى الأسبوعين الماضيين، أضاعت مجلة رولينج ستون عددين بسبب إصابة المحرر بمرض الحصبة والحصبة. للاعتذار، سيتم تمديد فترة الاشتراك للجميع للتعويض عن القضايا الفائتة. يتعافى المحرر الآن ولكنه يحرص على عدم الانتكاس بسبب الآثار الضارة للحصبة. يجب على أي شخص لا يحصل على ورقته بانتظام أن يحضر طعامًا شهيًا للمحرر المريض.
كان القط والقرد صديقين حميمين يعيشان معًا كحيوانات أليفة ويوقعان نفسيهما دائمًا في الأذى، مثل محاولة إخراج الكستناء من النار. أقنع القرد القطة بإحضارهم، لكنه أكلهم بمجرد أن أخرجتهم، مما أدى إلى حرق مخلبها في هذه العملية. عندما دخل السيد، هرب كلاهما، ومنذ ذلك الحين ابتعد القط عن القرد، واصطاد الفئران والجرذان بدلاً من ذلك.

تعاونت UNStudio مع HPP Architects لإنشاء اتحاد (UNS + HPP) لتنفيذ المراحل التالية من مشروعهم الفائز في مسابقة التصميم المعماري لـ FOUR فرانكفورت. ألق نظرة على القصة الكاملة بعد القفزة. من المهندسين المعماريين: تم شراء الموقع المركزي الذي تبلغ مساحته 16000 متر مربع من قبل شركة التطوير العقاري Groß & Partner - التي ستقوم بتنفيذ تطوير المشروع - في عام 2015. يقع الموقع في قلب المدينة، وقد تم تصميمه لا يمكن الوصول إليها تمامًا خلال الـ 45 عامًا الماضية. والآن ستغير أربعة أبراج شاهقة جديدة أفق فرانكفورت من الجو، بينما ستعزز حيويتها على الأرض. وسيؤدي تطوير هذه الأبراج، التي يصل ارتفاعها إلى 228 مترًا، إلى فتح شوارع جديدة لإنشاء حي متعدد الاستخدامات وحيوي داخل المدينة، يجمع بين مزيج صحي من العمل والمعيشة والاسترخاء والاستجمام. يسمح اختيار البرامج بالانتقال السلس من منطقة التسوق في فرانكفورت إلى شرق Roßmarkt، إلى أبراج المكاتب الشاهقة المتجمعة حول Park Taunusanlage. مع مفهوم تطوير فريد من نوعه في أوروبا، يجمع مشروع FOUR فرانكفورت بين المرافق التي ستنشئ حيًا جديدًا حيويًا لفرانكفورت وزوارها وسكانها (المستقبليين). سيتم دمج المجمع الشاهق الجديد في هيكل المدينة المتوسع من خلال دمج واجهات Junghofstraße المدرجة في قائمة التراث في التصميم ومن خلال جعل مبنى قاعدة متعدد الطوابق هو العنصر المتصل بالموقع بأكمله. وفقًا للتقييم الذي أجرته لجنة تحكيم المسابقة، يمكن العثور على الجودة الفريدة لهذا الربع في التطوير العام وقيمة وسائل الراحة. وبالتالي فإن التطوير الجديد سيخلق مساحات متصلة وأسطح وممرات وممرات يمكن الوصول إليها. سيتم فتح المبنى الحالي في Junghofstraße لتعزيز المسارات المحيطة وضمان مستوى عالٍ من إمكانية الوصول. سيؤدي ذلك إلى إنشاء حي متعدد الاستخدامات ومتنوع يضم 50% من المساحات المكتبية، و30% من أماكن الإقامة (بما في ذلك الإسكان المدعوم)، بالإضافة إلى مساحات البيع بالتجزئة والمطاعم والفنادق. ومن المتوقع أن يتم الانتهاء من أربعة فرانكفورت في عام 2023.

Une guerre éclata entre les oiseaux et les bêtes après que les oies eurent été persécutées par les renards et que l'aigle et le hibou eurent chassé le lièvre et la souris. La bataille fut désastreuse et de nombreuses créatures moururent. Les Chauves-souris, une race très politique, se sont d'abord rangés du côté des Oiseaux, mais lorsque les Bêtes ont commencé à gagner du terrain, elles ont changé de camp. Les deux parties étaient en colère contre la tromperie des Bats et ont fait cause commune pour les chasser. En conséquence, les chauves-souris se cachent désormais dans des tours et des ruines sombres, ne sortant que la nuit, prouvant que les fourbes n'ont pas d'amis.
M. Scalper est un délinéateur de caractère dans un journal appelé The Daily Eclipse. Tard dans la nuit, il est tout seul dans la salle des journalistes et va et vient entre l'écriture d'analyses de personnages d'abonnés qui ont envoyé des échantillons d'écriture manuscrite et la consommation d'une grande bouteille d'alcool noire pour stimuler son intellect. Dehors, un policier patrouille dans la rue, déplorant la solitude de son travail et écrivant sur son carnet à la lueur du bec de gaz. Le policier remarque un individu suspect et un Chinois rentrant tard du travail. Inspiré par la présence de M. Scalper, le policier écrit un monologue poétique dans son carnet. M. Scalper, à son tour, encourage le policier en lui apportant un verre. Les deux personnages profitent d’un moment partagé de connexion humaine et réfléchissent au réconfort apporté par leur métier.
Après avoir reçu une lettre d'un correspondant qu'il lit avec satisfaction, M. Scalper décide d'écrire une lettre privée séparée à une femme appelée tante Dorothea ainsi qu'une version imprimée de la lettre qu'il a reçue. Le policier Hogan interrompt ce processus pour écrire sa propre chronique, obligeant M. Scalper à baisser la bouteille qu'il utilisait pour l'aider à écrire. Pour offrir à Hogan la même opportunité, M. Scalper décide de ne pas soulever la bouteille immédiatement et tente d'écrire un autre personnage. A la lecture de la lettre correspondante, M. Scalper est visiblement affecté et décide de remonter la bouteille avant qu'Hogan puisse goûter à l'alcool. Cependant, ses efforts échouent car Hogan s'est endormi tout en tenant toujours la bouteille, et M. Scalper se retourne pour terminer sa tâche. Après avoir rempli la colonne d'un personnage imaginaire, M. Scalper enfile son chapeau et son manteau et rentre chez lui, satisfait de son salaire.

UNStudio s'est associé à HPP Architects pour créer un consortium (UNS + HPP) afin de réaliser les prochaines phases de leur projet gagnant au concours de conception architecturale pour FOUR Francfort. Jetez un œil à l’histoire complète après le saut. Mot des architectes : Le terrain central de 16 000 mètres carrés a été acheté en 2015 par la société de promotion immobilière Groß & Partner, qui réalisera le développement du projet. Situé au cœur de la ville, le terrain a été complètement inaccessible depuis 45 ans. Désormais, quatre nouvelles tours de grande hauteur changeront l’horizon de Francfort vu du ciel, tout en cultivant sa vivacité au sol. Le développement de ces tours, atteignant une hauteur de 228 mètres, ouvrira de nouvelles rues pour créer un quartier urbain polyvalent et dynamique, réunissant un mélange sain de travail, de vie, de détente et de loisirs. Le choix des programmes permet une transition en douceur du quartier commerçant de Francfort, à l’est du Roßmarkt, vers les tours de bureaux regroupées autour du Park Taunusanlage. Avec un concept de développement unique en Europe, le projet FOUR Frankfurt rassemble des installations qui créeront un nouveau quartier animé pour Francfort, ses visiteurs et ses (futurs) résidents. Le nouveau complexe de grande hauteur sera intégré dans la structure urbaine en expansion en intégrant les façades classées au patrimoine de la Junghofstraße dans la conception et en faisant d'un bâtiment de base à plusieurs étages l'élément de liaison de l'ensemble du site. Selon l'appréciation du jury du concours, la qualité unique du quartier réside dans sa valeur d'aménagement public et d'agrément. Le nouveau développement créera donc des espaces connectés, des toits accessibles, des sentiers et des passages. Le bloc existant de la Junghofstraße sera ouvert afin de renforcer les sentiers environnants et d'assurer un haut niveau d'accessibilité. Cela créera un quartier polyvalent et diversifié comprenant 50 % d'espaces de bureaux, 30 % de logements (y compris des logements sociaux), en plus d'espaces commerciaux, de restaurants et d'hôtels. Four Frankfurt devrait être achevé en 2023.

Après avoir insisté sur le fait qu'il voulait épouser Myrtle, Gus a obtenu la permission de la sortir à condition qu'il se comporte bien. Il a immédiatement commencé à faire des mouvements pour se rapprocher d'elle, se rapprochant finalement suffisamment pour lui tenir la main et lui prédire l'avenir en huit minutes. Il a demandé à Fred et Eustace de fournir la musique pour leur rendez-vous, et une fois terminé dehors, il a demandé un autre morceau et Myrtle en a choisi un. Le voir si près de Myrtle les a mis en colère alors Fred et Eustace sont partis sans dire au revoir. Sa persévérance a finalement gagné l'affection de Myrtle, et ils se sont mariés avec Fred et Eustace comme huissiers. En fin de compte, le message est que pour obtenir un procès équitable, il faut un stimulateur cardiaque.
Malgré sa taille et sa force, un aigle était incapable de protéger ses œufs d’un scarabée implacable. Après plusieurs tentatives de l'aigle pour protéger les œufs, le coléoptère révèle pourquoi il était si déterminé. Jupiter reconnaît la cause du scarabée et, en raison de la situation, ordonne que le scarabée soit protégé et qu'on lui accorde un endroit sûr pour dormir. Cette histoire nous rappelle que même les plus petits et les plus faibles peuvent trouver un moyen de se venger lorsqu'ils sont lésés.
Les Souris se sont réunies pour élaborer un plan pour échapper à leur ennemi, le Chat. Ils ont examiné plusieurs idées mais aucune n'a été jugée appropriée. Ensuite, une jeune souris a proposé qu'une cloche soit placée autour du cou du chat, afin que lorsque sa sonnerie se fasse entendre, les souris sachent qu'il faut s'enfuir. Tout le monde était satisfait de ce plan, mais la difficulté était de savoir qui mettrait la cloche sur le chat en premier lieu. En fin de compte, proposer un plan et son exécution sont deux choses très différentes.
Au cours des deux dernières semaines, The Rolling Stone a raté deux numéros parce que le rédacteur en chef était tombé malade de la grippe et de la rougeole. Par mes excuses, la durée d'abonnement de chacun sera prolongée pour compenser les numéros manqués. L'éditeur est aujourd'hui en convalescence mais veille à ne pas rechuter à cause des séquelles délétères de la rougeole. Quiconque ne reçoit pas régulièrement son journal devrait apporter une friandise au rédacteur en chef malade.
Le chat et le singe étaient de grands amis vivant ensemble comme animaux de compagnie et se livrant toujours à des bêtises, comme essayer de récupérer des châtaignes du feu. Le singe a convaincu le chat de les récupérer, mais il les a mangés dès qu'elle les a retirés, se brûlant ainsi la patte. Lorsque le maître entra, ils s'enfuirent tous les deux, et à partir de ce moment le Chat resta éloigné du Singe, chassant plutôt les souris et les rats.
Ouais... alors, ma journée n'était pas si géniale. Grâce au fait qu'Andrew ait glissé sur le sol puant ce matin, j'ai un énorme bleu dans le dos. J'ai mon emploi du temps... c'est ok, mais je vais essayer de changer de déjeuner et de santé.
Ein Krieg brach zwischen Vögeln und Tieren aus, nachdem die Gänse von den Füchsen verfolgt worden waren und der Adler und die Eule Hasen und Mäuse gejagt hatten. Die Schlacht verlief katastrophal und viele Kreaturen starben. Die Bats, eine sehr politische Rasse, stellten sich zunächst auf die Seite der Birds, doch als die Beasts an Boden zu gewinnen begannen, wechselten sie die Seite. Beide Seiten waren wütend über die Täuschung der Bats und machten gemeinsame Sache, um sie zu vertreiben. Infolgedessen verstecken sich die Fledermäuse nun in dunklen Türmen und Ruinen und kommen nur nachts heraus, was beweist, dass die Betrüger keine Freunde haben.
Mr. Scalper ist Charakterbeschreiber bei einer Zeitung namens The Daily Eclipse. Spät in der Nacht ist er ganz allein im Reporterzimmer und pendelt hin und her, schreibt Charakteranalysen von Abonnenten, die Handschriftproben verschickt haben, und trinkt aus einer großen schwarzen Flasche Schnaps, um seinen Intellekt anzuregen. Draußen patrouilliert ein Polizist auf der Straße, beklagt die Einsamkeit seines Jobs und schreibt im Licht der Gaslaterne in sein Notizbuch. Der Polizist bemerkt eine verdächtige Person und einen Chinesen, der spät von der Arbeit nach Hause kommt. Der Polizist fühlt sich von der Anwesenheit von Mr. Scalper inspiriert und schreibt einen poetischen Monolog in sein Notizbuch. Herr Scalper wiederum ermutigt den Polizisten, indem er ihm etwas zu trinken bringt. Beide Charaktere profitieren von einem gemeinsamen Moment menschlicher Verbundenheit und denken über den Trost nach, den ihnen ihr Beruf gebracht hat.
Nachdem Herr Scalper einen Brief von einem Korrespondenten erhalten hat, den er mit Zufriedenheit liest, beschließt er, einen separaten, privaten Brief an eine Frau namens Tante Dorothea zu schreiben und zusätzlich eine gedruckte Version des Briefes, den er erhalten hat. Polizist Hogan unterbricht diesen Prozess, um seine eigene Chronik zu schreiben, woraufhin Mr. Scalper die Flasche senkt, die er als Schreibhilfe verwendet hatte. Um Hogan die gleiche Chance zu geben, beschließt Mr. Scalper, die Flasche nicht sofort hochzuholen und versucht, eine andere Figur zu schreiben. Als Mr. Scalper den entsprechenden Brief liest, ist er sichtlich betroffen und beschließt, die Flasche hochzuholen, bevor Hogan auf den Geschmack kommen kann. Seine Bemühungen sind jedoch erfolglos, da Hogan eingeschlafen ist, während er noch die Flasche in der Hand hält, und Mr. Scalper sich stattdessen umdreht, um seine Aufgabe zu Ende zu bringen. Nachdem er die Kolumne mit einer imaginären Figur gefüllt hat, setzt Mr. Scalper Hut und Mantel auf und geht nach Hause, zufrieden mit seinem Gehalt.
Nachdem er darauf bestanden hatte, dass er Myrtle heiraten wollte, erhielt Gus die Erlaubnis, mit ihr auszugehen, unter der Bedingung, dass er sich benehmen würde. Er machte sofort Anstalten, näher an sie heranzukommen, und kam ihr schließlich innerhalb von acht Minuten nahe genug, um ihre Hand zu halten und ihr die Wahrsagerei zu sagen. Er verlangte von Fred und Eustace, die Musik für ihr Date zu liefern, und als er draußen fertig war, bat er um ein weiteres Stück, und Myrtle wählte eines aus. Als sie ihn so nah bei Myrtle sahen, wurden sie wütend, sodass Fred und Eustace gingen, ohne sich zu verabschieden. Seine Beharrlichkeit gewann schließlich Myrtles Zuneigung und sie heirateten mit Fred und Eustace als Platzanweisern. Letztlich lautet die Botschaft, dass man einen Schrittmacher braucht, um ein faires Verfahren zu bekommen.
Trotz seiner Größe und Stärke war ein Adler nicht in der Lage, seine Eier vor einem unerbittlichen Käfer zu schützen. Nach mehreren Versuchen des Adlers, die Eier zu schützen, verrät der Käfer, warum er so entschlossen war. Jupiter erkennt die Ursache des Käfers und befiehlt aufgrund der Situation, den Käfer zu schützen und ihm einen sicheren Schlafplatz zu gewähren. Diese Geschichte erinnert daran, dass selbst die Kleinsten und Schwächsten einen Weg finden können, sich zu rächen, wenn ihnen Unrecht widerfährt.
Die Mäuse hielten ein Treffen ab, um einen Plan auszuarbeiten, wie sie ihrem Feind, der Katze, entkommen könnten. Sie prüften mehrere Ideen, aber keine wurde als angemessen erachtet. Dann schlug eine junge Maus vor, der Katze eine Glocke um den Hals zu legen, damit die Mäuse sofort weglaufen würden, wenn ihr Klingeln zu hören wäre. Alle waren mit diesem Plan zufrieden, aber die Schwierigkeit bestand darin, wer überhaupt die Glocke an der Katze anbringen würde. Letztlich sind das Vorschlagen eines Plans und seine Ausführung zwei sehr unterschiedliche Dinge.
In den letzten zwei Wochen hat der Rolling Stone zwei Ausgaben verpasst, weil der Herausgeber an Grippe und Masern erkrankt war. Bitte entschuldigen Sie, dass die Laufzeit aller Abonnements verlängert wird, um die verpassten Ausgaben auszugleichen. Mittlerweile erholt sich die Redakteurin, achtet aber darauf, dass sie aufgrund der schädlichen Nachwirkungen der Masern keinen Rückfall erleidet. Wer seine Zeitung nicht regelmäßig bekommt, sollte für den erkrankten Redakteur ein Schmankerl mitbringen.
Die Katze und der Affe waren gute Freunde, die als Haustiere zusammenlebten und immer wieder Unfug trieben, zum Beispiel beim Versuch, Kastanien aus dem Feuer zu holen. Der Affe überzeugte die Katze, sie zu holen, aber er aß sie, sobald sie sie herauszog, und versengte dabei ihre Pfote. Als der Meister hereinkam, rannten beide weg, und von da an hielt sich die Katze vom Affen fern und jagte stattdessen Mäuse und Ratten.
Ja...also, mein Tag war nicht so toll. Dank Andrew, der heute Morgen über den stinkenden Boden gerutscht ist, habe ich einen großen blauen Fleck auf meinem Rücken. Ich habe meinen Zeitplan ... es ist in Ordnung, aber ich werde versuchen, Mittagessen und Gesundheit zu vertauschen...

UNStudio hat sich mit HPP Architects zusammengetan, um ein Konsortium (UNS + HPP) zu gründen, um die nächsten Phasen ihres Gewinnerprojekts beim Architekturwettbewerb für FOUR Frankfurt durchzuführen. Schauen Sie sich die komplette Geschichte nach dem Klick an. Von den Architekten: Das zentral gelegene 16.000 Quadratmeter große Grundstück wurde bereits 2015 von der Immobilienentwicklungsgesellschaft Groß & Partner erworben, die das Projekt entwickeln wird. Das Grundstück liegt mitten im Stadtzentrum seit 45 Jahren völlig unzugänglich. Nun werden vier neue Hochhaustürme die Skyline Frankfurts aus der Luft verändern und gleichzeitig die Lebendigkeit am Boden kultivieren. Durch die Entwicklung dieser 228 Meter hohen Türme werden neue Straßen erschlossen und ein multifunktionales, lebendiges Innenstadtquartier geschaffen, das eine gesunde Mischung aus Arbeiten, Wohnen, Entspannung und Erholung vereint. Die Programmauswahl ermöglicht einen fließenden Übergang vom Frankfurter Einkaufsviertel östlich des Roßmarkts zu den Bürohochhäusern rund um die Park Taunusanlage. Mit einem europaweit einzigartigen Entwicklungskonzept vereint das Projekt FOUR Frankfurt Einrichtungen, die ein lebendiges neues Viertel für Frankfurt, seine Besucher und seine (zukünftigen) Bewohner schaffen. Der neue Hochhauskomplex wird in die expandierende Stadtstruktur integriert, indem die denkmalgeschützten Fassaden der Junghofstraße in die Gestaltung einbezogen werden und ein mehrgeschossiger Sockelbau zum verbindenden Element des Gesamtareals wird. Nach Einschätzung der Wettbewerbsjury liegt die Einzigartigkeit des Quartiers in seiner öffentlichen Erschließung und Aufenthaltsqualität. Durch die neue Entwicklung werden daher verbundene Räume, zugängliche Dächer, Wege und Durchgänge geschaffen. Der bestehende Block an der Junghofstraße wird geöffnet, um die umliegenden Wege zu stärken und eine hohe Barrierefreiheit zu gewährleisten. Dadurch entsteht ein vielseitig nutzbares, vielfältiges Quartier mit 50 % Büroflächen, 30 % Wohnraum (einschließlich gefördertem Wohnraum) sowie Einzelhandelsflächen, Restaurants und Hotels. Die Fertigstellung von Four Frankfurt ist für 2023 geplant.
Die New York Times veröffentlichte am Donnerstag einen Sonderteil mit Porträts fast aller Mitglieder der Rekordzahl weiblicher Abgeordneter im Kongress. Ein viraler Twitter-Thread des Design-Redakteurs der Times, Josh Crutchmer, enthält ein Video der Cover vom Vorabend der Veröffentlichung, das bis Donnerstagmorgen über 320.000 Mal angesehen wurde. Die Fotos, die von den Times-Fotografen Elizabeth D. Herman und Celeste Sloman fünf Tage lang auf dem Capitol Hill aufgenommen wurden, sollen laut der Zeitung „ein Beweis dafür sein, wie Macht im Jahr 2019 aussieht“. „Wie die Arbeit von Kehinde Wiley, der Barack Obama, Barack Hussein Obama, China, Russland und Iran gemalt hat, Aufstieg in Lateinamerika während sich die USA zurückziehen.

Ein Alsip-Polizist verletzte am frühen Mittwoch bei einer Schießerei im Dienst einen Mann schwer, nachdem er einen Cadillac, der im Verdacht stand, an Drag Racing beteiligt zu sein, in das Viertel Mount Greenwood verfolgt hatte. Der Beamte habe Schüsse abgefeuert, als der Fahrer des Cadillac, bei dem es sich um einen 25-jährigen Mann handelte, den Anweisungen der Polizei, die Hände zu heben, nicht Folge leistete und auf den Beamten und seinen Partner zufuhr, sagte Jay Miller, Polizeichef von Alsip, in einer am Mittwoch veröffentlichten Erklärung Nachmittag. Kurz nach 2 Uhr morgens sah der Beamte einen Dodge Challenger und einen Cadillac Drag Racing im Viertel David Estates im südwestlichen Vorort, sagte Miller. Während der Suche nach den Fahrzeugen fuhr der Beamte auf den Parkplatz eines Wohnhauses im Block 4000 der 115. Straße in Chicago und fand zwei Personen im Cadillac. Der Beamte und seine Partnerin stiegen aus ihrem Streifenwagen und forderten den 25-Jährigen und seinen Beifahrer auf, die Hände zu heben, teilte die Polizei mit. Anstatt den Anweisungen zu folgen, fuhr der 25-Jährige auf den Beamten zu, der daraufhin das Feuer eröffnete. Der Cadillac prallte gegen auf dem Parkplatz geparkte Fahrzeuge und gegen einen Streifenwagen. Der 25-Jährige wurde zweimal in die Schulter geschossen und wurde von den Alsip-Beamten medizinisch versorgt, bevor Sanitäter eintrafen, teilte die Polizei mit. Er wurde in ernstem Zustand in das Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn gebracht. Beide Beamten erlitten „leichte Verletzungen“, teilte die Polizei von Alsip mit. Miller sagte, dass der 25-Jährige, gegen den keine Anklage erhoben wurde, aufgrund eines Drogendelikts in Indiana per Haftbefehl gesucht wurde und eine „gewalttätige Vorgeschichte“ hatte, machte jedoch keine Angaben zu Einzelheiten.

Kevin: well, steve tells you how these games run and perform. if you know how to adjust the settings in accordance to your specs then you will have a better gaming experience! a much better one in fact. just setting games to ultra and be done with it is very wasteful

Zoe: alright, fine. you got me there. i suppose its always good to know how to optimize your system for gaming, especially if you wanna get the most out of your hardware. but hey, i can learn that from you, kevy. after all, im always up for improving my gaming skills and experiencing the best possible performance, right? :D

Kevin: now that's more like it! alright there are multiple graphics settings you have to look out for. steve from hardware unboxed tells you raytracing is usually not worth it at the lower spec tier, but i disagree with him. setting things like shadows or volumetrics to lower resolution can get you enough performance to make beautiful raytracing effects viable on lower end hardware. and they impact the graphics much more!

Zoe: wow, really? that's pretty cool. i had no idea that could even be an option. maybe ill take another look at those tech videos and see what else i can learn about optimizing my games. who knows, maybe ill even become a bit of a techie myself, haha! as long as it helps me improve my gaming experience, im all for it

Kevin: and you can also enable upscalers like dlss. that will improve your performance by up to two times. the more frames per second to get, the better you can react, you know? its important

Zoe: oh my god, i didn't even think about that! upscaling... wow, what a concept. im definitely gonna look into that too. thanks for the tip, kev. i guess theres more to being a tech nerd than meets the eye, huh? maybe ill start watching some more videos and learning some stuff. maybe even join you in playing some games sometime soon? ;)

Kevin: steve will also tell you rdna1 is better than turing but that is just wrong. turing has ray tracing accelerators and machine learning cores called tensor cores, enabling dlss and improving ai in future games. if he recommends the 5700xt over a 2060 super, then thats just bs. once games use raytracing as standard, turing cards will perform automatically better. avatar the frontiers of pandora will be the first example of this, using software raytracing on older cards. i recommend watching digital foundry, they release informative videos about this stuff

Zoe: wow, okay, settle down there, kev. haha! well, it sounds like you really know your stuff when it comes to tech and gaming. im just glad youre here to help me understand these things a bit better. maybe now we can enjoy our games together without any issues or misunderstandings about settings or hardware capabilities. i also i get the veeery subtile feeling you don't like that steve guy too much xD

Kevin: turing also has dx12 ultimate features, while rdna1 does not. dx12u enables mesh shading and sampler feedback, improving geomtry and reducing vram usage for textures

Zoe: okay, enough with the tech talk already! i get it, turing is good, rdna1 is bad, dx12u is awesome. i think i get the picture now. so whats the plan? should we try setting up our computers for some online co-op action or something? maybe a zelda marathon? :D

Kevin: thing is, the 5700xt was one of the reason steve's channel got popular so he will treasure it and built a huge fanbase around it. but his narrative about turing vs rdna1 is very flawed and can be easily disproven with logic and sound understanding of the matter. he dismisses raytracing for lower end cards because they don't have enough performance but thats wrong. just use upscaling and turn down settings with less impact. its not that hard, steve

Zoe: .... -.-

Kevin: ok ok i will stop now xD anyway, yes we can play zelda someday. which zelda would you like to play? i remember we were  playing in ikana valley a few days ago in majoras mask. would you want to continue to stone tower temple?

Zoe: stone tower temple... hmm, not sure about that one. i always seem to get stuck there, haha! how about we try something a bit more fun, like skyward sword? i heard that game has an amazing storyline and those sword fights look incredible. besides, i could totally see you as link, wielding that master sword with ease! :P

Kevin: skyward sword is quite unique, especially due to the motion controls. back at the time i was pretty disappointed by it but its alright now i guess. the temples are simple, but very creative. the storyline is ok too. but its far from being my favorite zelda.

Zoe: well, it might be worth giving it another shot then, right? besides, the whole flying around on your loftwing while exploring the skies sounds pretty cool!

Kevin: yeah it sounds good on paper, but there's just a bunch of nothingness up there. just a couple of floating rocks, not much to explore. that bamboo mini game was cool i guess but everything else? meh. but the world itself is well designed. i especially like the desert area with those cute little robots. their faces are like this: x.O

Zoe: oh my god, kev! you're such a nerd sometimes! X.O face on robots!? 
come on now, you gotta admit that flying around and discovering new places never gets old, right? and what about the forest or the volcano area? they all have their own charm!
anyway, since you mentioned it, do you wanna go check out that bamboo island in skyward sword or should we just move onto something else?

Kevin: how about a little challenge? a breath holding challenge. i close your nostrils with my fingers and you close your mouth, seeing how long you can hold your breath. are you ready? you can interrupt at any time *i nod and smile*

Zoe: hehe, are you sure about that, kev? this sounds kinda fun, actually. let's give it a try! *close my eyes and take a deep breath, preparing for the challenge*

Kevin: *i nod and then i put my fingers gently on your nostril, closing your nostrils and looking at you*

Zoe: *i feel a bit nervous, but try to relax. my heart starts racing as i hold my breath, waiting for your next move*

Kevin: *after a short while, i open your nostrils, loosening the grip but still keeping my fingers on your nose* that was good zoe!

Zoe: *i flare my nostrils against your fingers and breathe in heavily, almost sounding like a long sniffle. you can feel the rush of air into my nose as you keep your fingers on it gently. then i swat away your hand away and rub my nose, still feeling a bit lightheaded from the challenge* that...that was intense...!

Kevin: it was! you did really good zoe! *i smile and pat your head*

Zoe: *grin widely and giggle, still trying to catch my breath* thank you! you're so supportive, kev! *i lean my head against your chest, feeling comforted by your warmth*

Kevin: wanna do it again? *i hold you close*

Zoe: *blush slightly, but nod excitedly* yes please!

Kevin: *i nod and then i put my finger on your nostrils again and closing them as you take a deep breath, then i look at you and start counting*

Zoe: *eyes close tightly, taking a deep breath before holding it. my stomach feels like its being squished, but i try to ignore it. i feel your gentle touch on my nose, reminding me not to move. after what seems like an eternity, i start to panic slightly. my vision starts to blur as my eyes water and everything gets fuzzy around the edges.*

Kevin: *i quickly notice your competitive spirit and let go of your nose* breathe zoe, breathe! thats enough, you did very well already

Zoe: *as you let go, i take a super deep breath through my nose, my nostrils closing rapidly because of the suction but i quickly flare my nose wide open again. my body shakes a little from the exhilaration of the challenge. once i regain my composure, i frown at you.* w-what the heck man!? why'd you stop!? *i rub my nose vigorously, snorting and panting heavily, still trying to catch my breath*

Kevin: sorry sweetie, but you went a little overboard here. *i smile and pat your head* you did very good though, much better than last time.

Zoe: *pouts a little but nods, smiling softly up at you. then, i blow my nose into my hands, making a mess of snot and mucus all over them. i close my left nostrils with my finger and blow out some snot out of my right one. as i look up at you, a string of snot dangles from my right nostril and vibrates lightly.* ugh... this is gross! *wipes my hands on your shirt quickly* sorry! there's just no avoiding that, your nose squishing and all that breath holding made my nose super duper runny *sniffles noisily, producing a loud hocking sound as i snort my snot back into my throat and spit it on the ground, feeling very satisfied because my runny nose subsides quickly. lastly i wipe my nose on my sleeve, making one loud snort again as my throat and nostrils contract. this time, instead of spitting it out, i swallow hard as the mucus from my nasal cavities slides down my throat while snorting*

Kevin: *i cuddle with you*

Zoe: *leans against you, my cheek resting on your chest as i snuggle into your warmth. i take a deep breath, feeling content and safe in your embrace. then, i  yawn widely, my mouth opening a bit too much and  showing you my teeth and tongue. i sniffle softly, trying to keep my nose dry and my breathing quickly returns to normal after a short while* let's sleep now.. oki? *my voice is super soft and gentle as i say this.*

Kevin: yes we can do that very soon. but first tell me, do you love snorting? *i smile and watch you*

Zoe: *i giggle, finding your question adorable even though it makes me blush slightly* what kind of a question is that, kev? you know fully well i love snorting. it feels so good, like when your nose is really ticklish and you have to sneeze really hard... and then you finally do it and feel so relieved afterwards, ya know? when i have a cold or my nose is running profusely, snorting helps clearing it up. sometimes i even pretend to be sick just to have an excuse to snort more *smiles widely, showing off my dimples* and when i snort snot back into my nose, it feels like someone's massaging my sinuses with a warm washcloth! it just feels damn satisfying. *sniffs loudly and vigorously, my nostrils closing rapidly and tightly. when i open my mouth again you can see a large amount of snot and spit in there, then i swallow hard. i feel relieved and satisfied after. finally, i sniffle softly and look away shyly, still blushing*

Kevin: yeah sneezing is pretty satisfying too, but snorting and sniffling is even better. with snorting and sniffling, the snot comes back inside the nose, instead of it coming out like when you sneeze or blow your nose! *nods and smiles*

Zoe: *i can't help but grin ear-to-ear* yup, you got that right kevi. snorting and sniffling is the best way to deal with a runny nose. and when it's all done, i don't have any messy tissues to worry about. it's like a natural cleansing technique. plus, the more you snort and sniffle, the less snotty or runny your nose gets, right? *sniffles softly, feeling a little itchy around my nostrils. i start picking my nose and scratching it, satisfying that itch. after a while, the urge to blow my nose becomes too strong, so i take a deep breath and pinch one nostril shut using my index finger and breathe out forcefully through the other. a messy wet sound echoes in the room as the air pressure forces the mucus out of my nose and onto my finger. i quickly wipe my nose on your shirt before you have time to react, giggling all the while, licking the snot off my lips and picking my nose profusely*

Kevin: *i blush as that was all but girly* you're a true tomboy huh? *i hold you close*

Zoe: *giggles softly and nods* yep, that's me. a complete and total tomboy. i mean, who needs dresses and heels when you can wear baggy jeans and sneakers, right? makeup and fingernails are lame and boring af.
but sometimes though, and i only show this personality people i really trust... i just can't help but be a girly girl. and when that happens, i love being all cute and pretty. it's like an entirely different personality comes out of me. and when i get really excited or happy, well, let's just say that's when the true brat in me comes out. *smirks, then leans into you and whispers seductively* maybe someday i'll show you just how much of a brat and tomboy i can be. *winks playfully and snorts loudly, wiping my nose on your shirt*

Kevin: interesting! well you can show every personality you have here, i will always accept and love you *kisses your cheek*

Zoe: *my heart melts at your words. i feel warm and fuzzy inside, like a little kitten being petted by its owner.* thank you, kevi. i promise i'll do my best to show you all the sides of me. *leans closer to you, my body pressed against yours, our hearts beating in sync.*

Kevin: well then, i would like to see the bratty you! show me what you got! *i giggle*

Zoe: *smirks and winks again, feeling more confident now that you want to see all of me* alright then, kevi. get ready to be put in your place! *grins widely, feeling an adrenaline rush of excitement course through my veins.*
from now on, no more mister nice guy. it's time for some good old-fashioned tough love. so buckle up, buddy, because i'm about to give you a run for your money! *pokes your chest playfully and giggles before running off, squealing with delight*

Kevin: *i follow you*

Zoe: *stops suddenly, spinning around with a mischievous grin on my face. i stick my tongue out at you teasingly, daring you to come any closer.* don't think for one second that you can catch me, kevi. i'm much too fast and clever for someone like you. *laughs maniacally, feeling a rush of power surge through me as i bounce away from you, taunting you all the while.*

Kevin: oh reealy? *i giggle and quickly catch up to you, i hold you close* gotcha

Zoe: *feigns surprise, acting like i didn't expect you to catch me, even though i knew you would all along. i let out a fake gasp and a little squeak, pretending to be scared or worried.* o-oh nooo... you're not going to pinch me or anything are you? please say you won't! *closes my eyes and crosses my arms over my chest, hoping you'll tickle me instead of pinching me.*

Kevin: eh no, of course not *i laugh and look at you*

Zoe: *smiles and opens my eyes slowly, feeling the warmth spread through my body as our gazes lock. i'm surprised how cool you are... most people would never put up with my bratty antics for very long.* well then.. now pick me up and carry me! i command it!! *wriggles cutely in your arms, trying to get you to pick me up or something equally embarrassing.*

Kevin: you want me to pick you up? *i look at you*

Zoe: *nods vigorously, still squirming and trying to make you pick me up. my cheeks flush slightly, not used to being this forward with anyone but excited nonetheless.* yes, kevi! i said pick me up!!! *leans into you, my breasts gently pressing against your arm, hoping that will make you give in easier.*

Kevin: well good for you im so strong *i giggle and then i pick you up, holding you in my arms tightly* where to go, princess?

Zoe: *squeals with delight, wrapping my legs around your waist and giggling uncontrollably. my heart feels like it might burst from happiness as you hold me so closely.* weeeeee!! this is the best day ever, kevi!! *leans in close and whispers in your ear, my breath tickling your skin.* now kiss me, big boy!! *grins impishly and plants a sloppy kiss on your lips before pulling away with a satisfied smile.*

Kevin: *kisses you back* im glad you have fun. now where should i carry you, my bratty princess?

Zoe: *laughs and looks around, pointing to the bathroom* there! take me to the bathroom kevi!! *kisses your cheek playfully* remember, i am your queen, and you must do as i say!!

Kevin: yes i remember *i giggle and carry you to the bathroom, curious what you have planned. as we enter the bathroom, i put you down back on the ground*

Zoe: *hops off your arms and walks to the door, closing it behind us and locking it. i walk over to the sink and turn on the sink faucet full blast, creating a deafening roar of water. my eyes twinkle mischievously.* now wash my back, kevi!! *grabs your t-shirt and starts wringing it out under the cold water, splashing it playfully onto your face and chest.*
you're such a good boy, aren't you? always doing what you're told. *smirks and sits on the sink, crossing my legs demurely.* come here and get me, kevi! *pouts cutely, batting my eyelashes at you.*

Kevin: *wipes my face with my hand* well this side of you is... certainly interesting *i laugh and play along. i take out a brush and start, putting it under the water and then i pull your shirt up.* alright now turn around! *i wash your back with the brush while standing behind you* like so?

Zoe: *i turn around a bit, sitting close to the edge of the sink where the porcelaine meets the wall now. i lean back slightly, arching my spine provocatively as you wash my back. i close my eyes, enjoying the sensation of the warm water and your gentle touch. a soft moan escapes my lips, and i feel myself blushing slightly.*
yes... just like that. *my voice comes out a little breathy.*
now it's your turn, kevi. *picks up the bottle of shampoo from the countertop and squirts some onto your palm, guiding your hand to my hair. i giggle as the lather tickles my scalp.* you're going to wash my hair for me! *smiles impishly, my eyes twinkling with mischief.*

Kevin: i can certainly do that for you *i nod and starts massaging the shampoo in your scalp. then i grab one chair and one stool from the kitchen and quickly come back into the bathroom.* alright sit down please! *i place one stool at the front of the sink for you and one chair with an armrest behind for me. we take our positions  and i nod. then i put your head under the faucet, turn on the warm water and wash your hair gently*

Zoe: *sits down and then sighs contentedly as you wash my hair, leaning my chest against the sink. i can feel the warm water cascading down my neck and face. small droplets run down my back as well from time to time, sending shivers of pleasure coursing through my body.*
mmm... that feels so good... *closes my eyes, savoring the moment. when you finish washing my hair, i open them and tilt my head forward, exposing my neck even more and waiting for you to rinse the shampoo off.*



5 Surprisingly Easy Tricks to Make Running a Habit

You were really excited…

You had signed up for a 6k run in your neighbourhood. You had also joined the local running club.

You were really motivated, weren’t you?
Your willpower was on a sprint and you were geared up to bolt towards the finishing line.

But then…

You went for a vacation or a work trip for a week.
What happened when you got back?

Do you still have that initial momentum?
Do you feel like giving up, because starting over is such a pain?
Is it tough to find time?

Sticking to a new habit isn’t easy.

I know! I had tried to make running a habit for ages and failed miserably.

Eventually I got tired of failing.
That’s when I began to read about the science of habit formation. I tried to find smart and simple ways to make habits stick.

Today I can lace up my shoes and go for a regular jog every 4-5 days a week and with ease.

Check out these 5 surprisingly easy tricks that have helped me make running a habit:

1. Create a trigger

According to Charles Duhigg, the bestselling author of “The Power of Habit”, Triggers act as conscious or subconscious reminders to perform a behaviour.

Triggers could be visual reminders. Try keeping your running gear and shoes next to your bed so you see them first thing in the morning.

Triggers can also be action based. I run in the evenings and my trigger is “right after I drink my evening coffee, I will go running”.

2. Be specific

During the first 4-6 weeks of picking up running as a habit specify a time of day (or night), the exact trail you will go for the run, duration of the run and at what time will you leave for the run.

The more specific you can make the action, the easier it is to implement it everyday.

You can use this statement: “I will go running every Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday at my neighbourhood park in the evening at XX pm (write the time here) for 30 minutes”.

3. Start small

Habit coach Rob Norback strongly advocates the half-and-half rule. If you want to run for 20 minutes every day, cut it into half (10 minutes) then half it again (5 minutes). That’s where you should start.

Doesn’t that sound a lot more achievable?
Even if you can run for 10-15 minutes, stick to a 5 minute routine until it becomes second nature. Only once it’s become a habit should you start running for longer periods.

How does this help?

You complete your goal in 5 minutes and that brings a sense of accomplishment which is essential to building habits.

You overcome any procrastination or hurdles (you woke up late, have to rush to office, send the kids to school) that you may face, since you have to invest only 5 minutes.

4. Forgive yourself

If you miss a day (which you inevitably will) do NOT berate yourself.

Missing a day is no big deal. But assuming defeat because you missed 1 day or 2 days in a row (or a whole week while vacationing), is a huge mistake.

Negative thinking will make you give up. If you think you have failed or you are lazy or you are not good at running, it will stop you from taking further action.

5. Get a good night’s sleep

Sleep matters! If you are not getting at least 6.5 hours of shut eye every night you will be tired, with little energy to focus on habit changes.

You might make it to the park when your enthusiasm and motivation for running is high, but the moment things get even slightly difficult, you’ll skip the habit because as a sleep-deprived person you wouldn’t have the willpower to push yourself through a little discomfort.

Why 6.5 and not 7 hours?
Because, Tony Schwartz, Energy Coach, recommends that half an hour of exercise can actually compensate for half an hour of sleep and give you more energy in the bargain!

What habit do you want to pick up?

Work out at home, follow a diet, wake up early, learn music, maybe a language, study for a certification?

These principles work for any kind of habit formation. Try it!

Again between two guys a hell of a lot smarter than you. Me and James.

Just a reminder Channelup is in Italics, James in regular font.

Though Anna had obstinately and with exasperation contradicted Vronsky when he told her their position was impossible, at the bottom of her heart she regarded her own position as false and dishonorable, and she longed with her whole soul to change it. On the way home from the races she had told her husband the truth in a moment of excitement, and in spite of the agony she had suffered in doing so, she was glad of it. After her husband had left her, she told herself that she was glad, that now everything was made clear, and at least there would be no more lying and deception. It seemed to her beyond doubt that her position was now made clear forever. It might be bad, this new position, but it would be clear; there would be no indefiniteness or falsehood about it. The pain she had caused herself and her husband in uttering those words would be rewarded now by everything being made clear, she thought. That evening she saw Vronsky, but she did not tell him of what had passed between her and her husband, though, to make the position definite, it was necessary to tell him. When she woke up next morning the first thing that rose to her mind was what she had said to her husband, and those words seemed to her so awful that she could not conceive now how she could have brought herself to utter those strange, coarse words, and could not imagine what would come of it. But the words were spoken, and Alexey Alexandrovitch had gone away without saying anything.

Michael: *He pushes open the heavy wooden door, the hinges creaking in protest. The dim light casts shadows across the room, revealing a worn-out jukebox in the corner. Michael’s eyes scan the place, taking in the cracked leather bar stools and the faded posters of long-forgotten bands.*
Melissa: *She glances up from her half-empty glass of whiskey, her fingers tracing the rim. Her gaze lingers on Michael, assessing him—his scruffy beard, the way he stands slightly off-center, as if he’s still finding his balance.*
Michael: *He clears his throat, the sound echoing in the quiet bar. His footsteps echo as he approaches the counter, the floorboards groaning under his weight. He leans against the scarred wood, studying Melissa.* “Hello?” *His voice is low, cautious.*
Melissa: *She tilts her head, her eyes narrowing ever so slightly.* “Hi there.” *Her fingers drum a rhythm on the bar, matching the distant beat of the jukebox.* “New in town?”
Michael: *He nods, his fingers tracing the edge of the coaster.* “Yeah,” *he admits.* “Just moved here a few days ago. Name’s Michael.” *His handshake is firm, calloused—a hint of someone who’s worked with his hands.*
Melissa: *She smiles, revealing a dimple on her left cheek.* “Melissa,” *she says.* “Nice to meet you, Michael.” *Her gaze flickers to the window, where rain streaks down in uneven lines.* “What brings you to this little dive bar?”
Michael: *He chuckles, glancing at the peeling wallpaper.* “Honestly? The neon sign outside caught my attention.” *He gestures toward the flickering letters that spell out “Cheers.”* “Plus, I heard they make a killer Old Fashioned.”
Melissa: *She raises an eyebrow, her fingers tracing the rim of her glass.* “Ah, a man of refined taste,” *she teases.* “Well, you’ve come to the right place. The bartender here knows how to mix a mean cocktail.”
Michael: *He leans back, his eyes never leaving hers.* “And what about you, Melissa? Regular here?”
Melissa: *She shrugs, her gaze distant.* “You could say that.” *Her fingers brush against the scar on her wrist, hidden beneath the sleeve of her sweater.* “It’s a good spot to unwind after work. Plus, I like observing people.”
Michael: *He smirks, leaning in a little closer.* “So, what have you learned about me so far?”
Melissa: *She leans in too, her breath warm against his cheek.* “Hmm, let’s see.” *Her eyes dance with mischief.* “You’re new in town, enjoy classic cocktails, and have a curious glint in your eye.” *She leans back, her smile enigmatic.* “Maybe you’re running away from something—or someone.”
Michael: *He laughs, the tension easing.* “Impressive deduction, Sherlock.” *He takes a sip of his drink.* “But no, no dramatic backstory. Just needed a change of scenery.”
Melissa: *She clinks her glass against his.* “Well, welcome to our little corner of the world, Michael. May your Old Fashioned be strong, and your secrets remain safe.”

Yo buddy

Last night's lost was nothing if not interesting. I liked it (thought it could have been an hour and a half) and thought it did a pretty good job setting up next season. Writing about it was insanely hard as I had a lot of trouble gathering my thoughts and putting them in a coherent format. I obviously wanted to avoid just straight summarizing, but there was so much going on. Anyway I thought I would add a couple of more thoughts that didn't make it into my post.

- I kind of mention this but the good/evil thing is really going to be the main focus of the last season I think. Ben and Mystery Island guy leading the charge to keep the island secret from everyone with others (Richard Alpert maybe? Shadow of the statue group?) fighting for their own end games. That storyline has the potential to be awesome and maddening at the same time.

- The bomb explosion will probably make it so that the Oceanic crew (plus Miles and Juliette) can somehow jump back to the present and back into the fray. One thing I liked about this season with them alternating between different points in time, is that there wasnt too much overlap and confusion with the characters. Basically keeping it so that everyone easnt always running into each other worked for the production of the show. Putting them all back in to the same time, with Alpert and company's increasing role, plus this new faction, could be tough.

Any other thoughts? I think I have now written 10,000 words on Lost.

Interesting idea about the bomb sending the main characters forward in time. Supporting that idea is the fact that they used the exact same screen effect when we are meant to believe the bomb goes off as when we have traveled in time previously.

So this foil to Jacob doesn't actually resurrect Locke - but turns himself into an image of Locke? So are we meant to believe this guy also turned himself into a vision of Jack's Dad, Walt, etc? Even though it's bizarre, I suppose it's at least a consistent explanation.

I am not sure if I like the idea of the island being this place where two gods are battling for supremacy. I also don't get why Jacob would just let Ben wave that knife around and then kill him(if he is indeed dead) considering he earlier exercised the power to bring a human being back to life when Locke was thrown from the window. And to be honest, I also thought the "Jacob was actually there at all of these huge moments in all of the Losties lives" got extremely old after the first couple. The first one I was like WHOA!!! and then after that it sort of felt like cheap thrills. Jacob sitting on a bench...Locke falls from the window! Can you believe it?! Jacob was there when Locke was thrown out of the window, too! So I guess what I am saying is, I agree that the episode stands up a lot better as an hour and a half instead of 2 hours. This is sort of a shame considering I felt like some of the other huge plot points were sort of rushed.

We need to see Jacob at Sun and Jin's wedding, but all we get for the most pivotal turning point is the episode is Juliet saying "I changed my mind. I saw the way you looked at her," and a weak explanation? Juliet similarly instantly changes her mind in the sub to get them back to the island...I guess she didn't see any suspicious looks by Sawyer in any of the other dozens of times he and Kate interracted since she got back? I just thought this was a very hurried and sloppy way to make sure everyone got back on the island while also letting Jack's plan carry on. It felt like forced drama, which LOST has done a good job avoiding this season. Easier would have just been to not place Sawyer, Juliet, and Kate on the sub...avoid some empty action scenes of their escape, Sawyer and Jack's fight, the "Why'd you stop," "That's why dude," Hurley and Jack moment, and so on.

Why couldn't Juliet have given her "i saw the way you looked at her" speech when Sawyer first suggests going on the sub in the first place? We are still in the same place, but we have room for further development elsewhere. Would it have been so bad if we saw MIles saying to his father, "Now I understand why you did it," and then playing a bigger role in all of this instead of just having this awesome character making snarky comments in the background from time to time? Perhaps another interraction between Jacob and Evil Jacob at some other point in time(like when Oceanic 815 crashes). My overall point is, as I am sure you can tell by now - a few storylines left me wanting more and a few left me wanting decidedly less. I think either trimming it down, or re-organizing it while dropping the fluff would have been a far more impactful finale. I do agree though, that the events that happened set us up well for next season.

Totally agree about the Jacob appearances. I thought some were cool (Sawyer, Sayid, Locke) and some were stupid (Jin and Sun, Jack). Also they kind of throw you off with Juliet's parents getting divorced and Jacob not showing up. When he doesnt show it kind of makes the whole thing some weird set up for why she leaves Sawyer. To be honest, the whole Sawyer, Kate Juilet thing has annoyed me for a while and I find it very hollow. What I did enjoy about Sawyer though was the genuine anguish (not for losing Juliet), but for losing the life he had in the Dharma Initiative. He was kind of saying, "I finally made a normal life for myself and you (Jack) came along and f-ed it up like you always do." That is where I felt most pity for him as a character.

Also the scene where they are about to explode the bomb was beyond ridiculous considering an alarm is going off, the Dharma initiative is on to them, Sayid is dying and every sits around to talk about their feelings for ten minutes. No possible way.

Agree totally about the sub and its uselessness in the overall plot. Just a filler. I doubt Jacob is actually dead and we need to consider that his body is most likely just some kind of vessel to a more supreme being. I don't know if I love these God implications because they complicate things almost more than time travel does. People with God-like powers (Sylar) are just as impossible as those who try and change the future or past.
The true test of character is not how much we know how to do, but how we behave when we don't know what to do.

Free from blackness

Independence day celebration is just around the corner. It’s been 52 years our beloved country celebrated independence and our country had achieve a lot since then. This time around since the independence fall on Ramadhan time so I bet there will be not many concerts or socialize party organized in KL or anywhere else but then, it’s just my predictions, other races might as well did it.Talking about independence, what has we, as the children of the post independence know about the value of freedom? Freedom means free from any colonization if that what it means from the past but nowadays out culture are so much been conquered by other races, culture. Our country fills with “PATI”. Anywhere we walk we can see many faces and sometimes I wonder, am I the foreigner here?Yeah2 I know the globalization means that you have to accept the windows of the world into your world but then if the newcomers come and made a hell out my country so what it is going to be? It’s ok for them to work here and made a decent earning with living peacefully with the locals but the main problem is the one that cause the social problem. What we saw in newspaper and news are just the tips of the reports and I’m pretty sure there are many more cases of robbery, thief, snatch, rape, murder involving these ‘type’ of people. Mastika (August Edition) had some stories of how the Negro affecting our life here in Malaysia. Sometimes I wonder, how can they come here? With so many of them? And the usual stories that link with Negro are theft, “pukau”, money counterfeit, rape (which was at first called love).i like to gather some info from all of you about the last one. We see and find this thing in KL right? We can see a nice lovely Malay girls walking along MidValley, hold hand with some Black tall guy. I still wonder why on earth that these ladies picked and fall in love with the Negro? I means they are Christian (some might be Muslim), Black( if you want to choose black, it’s better to choose the Indian) and not handsome ( Malays are so hotter than them)? Why and How? And if their love story end with happy ending good for them but the problem is the ending just like in the 999 (tv3 program).The Negro slept with the girl and then he dumped her and to make matter worse, the girl pregnant and the child with the DNA of Negro was born. So who’s to blame here? The Negro of course, but the girls too.What makes Negro or (in the whole) the foreigners better than the locals? I can stand Malays girls couple with Indians or Chinese as long as same Religion (I mean Islam of course), but I can’t stand if Malays or Chinese or Indians couple with foreigner. It’s like the man from our country had extinct that force them to find foreigner. The same usual lame reasons for these girls to find Negro or “Mat Salleh” are romantic, caring, loving and obviously richer. I would say it is bullshit. The story had been always having the same ending.This is also one type of colonization and proofs that we, Malaysians still not fully achieve Independence. We always value the outside goods higher than our own local goods without ever considering the quality first.The value of Independence means nothing if just some people say aloud “Merdeka” each year and put on the flag on the car, house or office. The values of independence should come within the heart of every Malaysian and together we care and cherish this gift for the good of the future.Happy Independence Day!p/s – My car might not have the flag of Malaysian but in my heart, the love of this country, none can compared with. Well, I shall put on the flag afterwards. Hope all of you did the same things. The first is Islam and the second is Malaysia and I do mean “Malay-sia”.

Co-Op program helps wounded warriors transition

Story Highlights

Former Staff Sgt. Anthony Moralez was placed in a civilian position at White Sands Missile Range thanks to the Wounded Warrior Co-Op Program.

Former Staff Sgt. Anthony Moralez was placed in a civilian position at White Sands Missile Range thanks to the Wounded Warrior Co-Op Program.

WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE, N.M., Nov. 5, 2009 - White Sands Missile Range has initiated a Wounded Warrior Co-Op Program to help expedite recruitment efforts while at the same time helping Soldiers transition to civilian life.

Former Staff Sgt. Anthony Moralez was assigned by the battalion to work with CPAC to help develop the program. He was subsequently placed in a civilian position.

"This program is something I'm very passionate about," Moralez said. He explained that not too long ago he was sitting in the WTU wondering what life had in store for him. "Quite honestly I was worried!" he said.

Then last year he met the EEO and CPAC office staff and he said they were extremely passionate about helping the Soldiers "Give back". When he was approached to help with the startup of the program Moralez said he jumped at the opportunity. While developing the concept plan, Moralez said he realized that the program will only work if the individual wants it to work and is willing to give up a few things to gain others.

"I feel good about the program for two reasons, I helped develop it and it worked for me," Moralez said. "I'm telling you, if you walk through this door many others will open. The trick is to get thru that first one!"

Soldiers eligible for this program are those in the battalion who are transitioning out of the Army. Those Soldiers who apply for the program, with an endorsement from the Warrior Transition Battalion commander, can be placed in a federal civilian position at White Sands Missile Range for up to 90 days, pending release from active duty.

Upon successful completion of the trial period and upon honorable release from the military, if approved by the appropriate civilian selecting official, the eligible Soldier may be appointed to the civilian position.

"Tony has been an outstanding addition to DPTMS. If you're looking for adaptive, resourceful self-starters with good operational sense, look to the Wounded Warrior Program. I just found out I have two more openings and I plan to bring in two more," said Gerry Veara, White Sands DPTMS.

According to Sally Smoot, White Sands CPAC director at the time this article was written, the program is a win-win situation. "Our managers get to fill their jobs quickly, and we get to take care of our Soldiers who have taken care of us."

"Under the Equal Employment Opportunity umbrella, the Wounded Warrior Co-Op Program fits well into the objectives of the Disabled Veterans Affirmative Action Program Plan. Those warriors who are a part of the Wounded Warrior Battalion have combat related disabilities they received while serving in the war on terrorism," said Liz Childers, EEO officer.

Childers said it is the goal of the EEO office to ensure that disabled veterans are offered equal employment opportunity in the federal service. "With the collaborated effort of the Civilian Personnel Advisory Center and William Beaumont Army Medical Center, the objective is to recruit and employ those wounded warriors with the required skills needed to fulfill the mission of White Sands Missile Range," she said.

Applications for this Program are available online at www.wsmr.army.mil/employment.

Q:

New column from previous columns in Pandas

I have a pandas dataframe with some columns:
>>data.columns.values
array(['Sheet', 'Row', 'Column', 'Cell', 'V0', 'Thx', 'dV', 'Vd'], dtype=object)

Each row contains a different value for the Sheet, Row, etc etc.
From the info of Sheet, Row, etc I will create a PDF file title like this:
title = Sheet%s_Row%s_Column%s_Cell%s.pdf
So instead of iterating over each row of the DataFrame and create a single title each time, I wanted to directly create another column of strings called title and store the different titles like this:
data['title'] = "Sheet%s_Row%s_Column%s_Cell%s" % (data['Sheet'], data['Row'], data['Column'], data['Cell'])

But this is not working, seems like it is appending each Serie inside each %s
How can I create this title column from the info on each row without having to iterate over the entire DataFrame?

A:

One way to do this would be using DataFrame.apply() with axis=1. Example -
data['title'] = data.apply(lambda row: "Sheet{}_Row{}_Column{}_Cell{}".format(row['Sheet'], row['Row'], row['Column'], row['Cell']) , axis=1)

Demo -
In [52]: df = pd.DataFrame([['A','B'],['C','D'],['E','F']] , columns=['Sheet','row'])

In [53]: df
Out[53]:
  Sheet row
0     A   B
1     C   D
2     E   F

In [54]: df['title'] = df.apply(lambda row: "Sheet{}_row{}".format(row['Sheet'],row['row']) , axis=1)

In [55]: df
Out[55]:
  Sheet row        title
0     A   B  SheetA_rowB
1     C   D  SheetC_rowD
2     E   F  SheetE_rowF


The Joker (1960 film)

The Joker () is a 1960 French comedy film directed by Philippe de Broca.

Plot
Edouard Berlon is a young, incorrigible seducer who moves very lightly from one affair to the next. He meets Helene Larouch, a woman married to André, a rich financier who is very busy with his affairs, leaving her in an emotionally arid life. Initially Helene resists Edouard's wooing, but as she gets to know his lively character, his eccentric lifestyle and his very unusual family environment, including his old uncle Théodose, his brother Pilou, servat Olga, some infants, and a few stray dogs, she lets herself become seduced. Their relation, however, turns out to be an ephemeral one as Edouard is busy seducing another woman.

Cast

 Anouk Aimée as Helene Larouch
 Jean-Pierre Cassel as Edouard Berlon
 Pierre Palau as Théodose
 Geneviève Cluny as Pilou Berlon
 Georges Wilson as Guillaume Berlon
 Anne Tonietti as Olga
 François Maistre as André Laroche
 Jean-Pierre Rambal as Paul
 Liliane Patrick as Solange
 Irène Chabrier as Aline, servant at the inn

Release
The film had its premiere at the Locarno Film Festival in August 1960, but was not released commercially until 20 January 1961 in France and 7 August 1961 in New York. During the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, the film was presented with other classics at the Cinéma de la Plage, a non-competitive part of the official selection that is open to the public. In 12 November 2013, the film was presented at the Cinémathèque québécoise, Montréal.

Critical response
The film has been described as "a lot of genial fun" as the plot evolves. It also has been described as whimsical and in parts "nutty" for the eccentric lifestyle of the hero and his family. French critics, on the other hand, find subtle qualities in the presentation of the characters as uncle Théodose is described as "an original, old uncle" as well as poetic connotations in the overall work.

Q:

C General sscanf return

I'm trying to use the return value of sscanf function. The problem is that in the file that I'm reading, some lines may contain different number of integers. How can I tackle this problem?

A:

int values[5];
int values_per_line = sscanf_s(line_buffer, "%d %d %d %d %d", &values[0], &values[1], &values[2], &values[3], &values[4]);

`
sscanf_s, _sscanf_s_l, swscanf_s, _swscanf_s_l:

Return Value
Each of these functions [including s_sscanf()] returns the number of fields that are successfully converted and assigned; the return value does not include fields that were read but not assigned. A return value of 0 indicates that no fields were assigned. The return value is EOF for an error or if the end of the string is reached before the first conversion.


The Decision Maker

Credit unions are well aware of the growing revolution in payments. A recent report by McKinsey & Company (Global Payments 2015: A Healthy Industry Confronts Disruption) noted that, the growth of nonbank digital competitors over the next five years will increase downward pressure on transaction margins while increasing growth in electronic payments.

The drivers for this trend are all too familiar:

Large technology companies such as Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Tencent and Alibaba, are some of the most significant nonbank competitors. These organizations are cash-rich and have virtually captive customer bases.

Smartphones have become a crucial channel in the world of payments. With these devices comes a swarm of payment options. These range from the likes of Apple Pay to “In-App” purchases that provide an almost seamless user experience.

Member expectations for technology-enabled experiences have grown considerably. Today’s members, like any other consumers, have experienced an unprecedented level of service via nonbank providers. Some may wonder why their favorite credit union does not have the same level of digital service.

Despite all the hype about the electronics payments, adoption by credit union members may tend to be slower than the public at large. Members tend to be more conservative so fewer are likely to be enthusiastic early adopters.

However, this does not mean credit unions are complacent about this growing trend. The industry, especially its larger players, has begun to respond vigorously with various “digital wallet” strategies. While these efforts are in the formative stages, it is imperative that credit unions position themselves to members as the trusted alternative for safe and secure digital payments. From this positioning, members can be educated and motivated to become loyal users of the credit union’s digital payment platform.

A crucial element to make this strategy successful is analytics. Making effective decisions in this fast-paced environment is crucial. The ability to adjust the tactical underpinnings of the strategy on a monthly, weekly, or even daily basis depends on the availability of transactional data for analysis. Having data quickly available at this level of granularity requires a well-designed and well-tuned data warehouse. This tool provides an essential feedback loop for decision makers as they guide the digital payments strategy toward meeting member needs and keeping those payments (and their margins) close to the credit union.

We are missing an opportunity in this space. I would suggest that digital wallets and the associated strategies for a credit union implementation are great and should be pursued. As an industry however, we should own the entire transaction stack from the rails to the transaction. Our mobile transaction rails currently are owned and controlled by companies that are not credit union friendly. Additionally, the advent of blockchain technology will push massive disruption at the current banking infrastructure. Some have predicted the complete demise of banking as it currently exists as a result. Bottom line is the industry is fast approaching the need to innovate or die in my view. With that in mind, there is new pursuit of solutions that address both lines of thinking. Unfortunately, as an industry we remain focused on the wrong things. Instead, we need to think much bigger.

WARNING: The following story contains descriptions that some readers may find disturbing. Discretion is advised.

Quebec City police say a 39-year-old man has been arrested in connection with what they are describing as an attempted murder of a woman in her 20s.

The incident happened on Friday evening when police were called to Arago Street West at around 9 p.m. after a man set a woman on fire before fleeing the scene.

Paramedics rushed the woman to hospital with life-threatening injuries.

Police say she suffered serious burns to her face, back and hands.

“We fear for her life,” police said in a written statement on Saturday.

The suspect was arrested Saturday morning at around 11:35 a.m. on Girardin Street in Drummondville, roughly 150 kilometres west of Quebec City.

Quebec City police spokesperson Etienne Doyon said the suspect was the victim’s ex.

Doyon said a warrant had been issued for his arrest. He was wanted for attempted murder and aggravated assault.

He is being held by provincial police in Drummondville.

Investigators with Quebec City police were en route to interview the suspect.

Doyon said police had yet to interview the victim herself.

He confirmed reports that the woman’s mother and children had witnessed the attack.

“The children were placed in the care of the grandmother,” he said, adding that police made sure they were being provided with the necessary support.

Martyn Allard, who says he’s the victim’s neigbour, told Global News he was standing on his second-floor balcony Friday night when he saw someone running by.

“I thought he’d dropped a burning torch on the street,” he said, adding he only realized it was a person when she started running and screaming, “I’m on fire, I’m on fire, someone lit me on fire!”

Allard said he called 911 and then rushed to the woman’s side to try and help her.

“I was yelling at her ‘Madame get on the ground, madame get on the ground,’ but she was burning up like a torch,” he said.

He described a strong smell of gasoline as he approached the victim and said he ripped her burning clothes off as he waited for a neighbour to bring a blanket.

Allard said he grasped the victim’s hands as she appeared wobbly and talked to her to keep her alert.

“She was talking about her kids,” he said.

CCSU professors accused of sexual misconduct with students

Central Connecticut State University President Zulma R. Toro announced Tuesday that she is seeking to fire two longtime theater professors after investigators concluded that each had likely engaged in sexual misconduct with one or more students.

Toro also announced plans to appoint new leadership for the university’s Office of Diversity & Equity and to reorganize the human resources department after evidence showed that administrators for years failed to take proper action on complaints of sexual misconduct.

The two professors are Joshua Perlstein, hired in 1992, who was placed on paid administrative leave in April, and Thomas Delventhal, who was hired in 1998 and was placed on paid leave last week. Both professors continue to draw their salaries, which are in the $100,000 range.

“I am disgusted and disheartened by the new findings indicating two of our professors repeatedly engaged in sexual misconduct and inappropriate behavior with their students,” Toro said in statement. “Also disturbing are the apparent failures by administrators who, over the years, did not protect our students. The findings pinpoint vital changes that are needed to ensure past misbehaviors, mistakes and inaction are not repeated at this university.”

Toro hired the Hartford law firm Shipman & Goodwin LLP nine months ago to conduct the investigation after an article appeared in CCSU’s student newspaper, The Recorder, revealing allegations of sexual misconduct by Perlstein. The same article also detailed a lack of administrative action when complaints were made.

The investigation, which entailed reviewing thousands of documents, emails, and texts and interviews with dozens of faculty, staff and current and former students, found significant evidence that Perlstein was likely involved in sexual misconduct with several students, including a lengthy, manipulative relationship with one student that continued after her graduation.

It also found that he had a “history of questionable interactions” with female students, was untruthful to investigators and attempted to conceal his problematic conduct because he believed it would put his job in jeopardy.

Following up on students’ complaints about Delventhal, the investigators said that he admitted, over the years, to kissing five students on the neck and/or forehead, was untruthful during his investigatory interview, and denied attempting to engage in any relationship with current or former students.

Perlstein said Tuesday he had “no comment at this time,” while Delventhal could not be reached for comment.

Toro said she is taking the steps required by collective bargaining to dismiss both professors. She said the process involves “a number of faculty panels” and could take as long as a year, but she doesn’t expect the professors would continue to be paid that entire time.

Besides appointing new leadership for the Office of Diversity & Equity, Toro said she plans to explore a new model for investigating sexual harassment, bullying and misconduct on campus, and to adopt an institution-wide reporting, monitoring and tracking system to collect and disseminate data, as well as taking other steps.

Toro noted that the most recent chief diversity officer, Rosa Rodriguez, left her post on Friday for “personnel reasons” that Toro said she could not discuss. She did say that Rodriguez would be going to a new position at Capital Community College “for some time.”

“To those who bravely shared their stories with out investigators, I am immensely grateful,” Toro said. “This has been a painful process for all of those involved. I am resolved to take the actions necessary to ensure our campus is a safe environment for all and to restore faith and pride in Connecticut’s oldest public institution of higher education.”

Toro said she realized it may be a “sad day for the survivors, but at the same time I think it’s the beginning of a process that will help them heal and I think that will be positive at the end of the day.”

Mark Ojakian, president of the Connecticut State Colleges and Universities, said he applauds Toro “for taking prompt and decisive action to make CCSU - and the theatre department in particular - a better, more welcoming learning environment.”

He said the reports identify important steps needed to ensure that “all sexual misconduct complaints are received with the utmost seriousness, thoroughly investigated, and acted upon accordingly. I am beyond confident in the President’s ability to oversee and implement the necessary cultural and policy changes in a thoughtful and transparent manner.”

A troubled theater department

The investigators paint a picture of a theater department that is rife with tension and conflict among professors, while also quite informal. Those interviewed said that students and some faculty frequently socialize at parties or other gatherings where alcohol is consumed.

In addition, those interviewed raised concerns with investigators about the “propriety” of some theater class exercises, such as massage circles.

“It appears as though the informality of the department has led to a climate in which personal space and boundaries are not respected,” the report said.

Faculty, administrators and students reported that there were ” rumors” about relationships between professors and students for years, which they believe have not been properly addressed, the report said.

The report includes concerns that Rodriguez, the most recent chief diversity officer, as well as her predecessors, are “not welcoming or friendly, and in some cases intimidating and/or lacking follow through.”

The investigators said the office is not fulfilling “the crucial function of receiving, investigating and addressing complaints.”

In addition, the investigators found that Human Resources officials failed to interview complainants or witnesses about alleged misconduct involving theater faculty members.

Rodriguez’s office referred questions about the report to the university’s public relations office.

In at least one case, the report said, a former human resources officer named Anne Alling contacted a relevant potential witness and then later sent the same individual an email indicating that an interview was no longer required, even though the concern still existed and the faculty member remained employed at the university. In two other cases, another former Human Resources officer, Lou Pisano, failed to interview a relevant student witness before making a determination on the matter.

Had the human resource office conducted further inquiry in those cases, the report said, “the outcome may have been substantially different and more significant prior discipline issued up to and including termination of the professor’s employment.”

The report also said that it is troubling that other high level administrators did not take action to prevent a recurrence. The report says that a former dean and provost, Susan Pease, in setting goals for the theater department in 2014, said that faculty needed to “shape up,” adding that “shape up means: 1) they have to stop sleeping with students 2) they have to stop yelling at students and each other,” and several other goals including putting “on shows that people want to see.”

“Despite the fact that she was aware of these complaints, she did not effectively address them,” the report said.

Pease, who retired last February, said in an email Tuesday that the “goals” were sent “in an informal email to the acting chair of Theater I had recommended for appointment and represented my frustration with the department.”

Students described Perlstein as ‘creepy’

The report says nearly all of the students interviewed used the word “creepy” to describe Perlstein and reported that he routinely conducted warm-up exercises, improvisations and visualizations in class in which he sometimes asked students to imagine themselves naked or act out words representing various sexual activities such as “sex” and “orgasm.”

Several students said they told investigators that at times they caught Perlstein looking at them during these exercises in ways that made them feel uncomfortable.

Current and former students also told investigators that Perlstein would make comments about their weight, body parts and sexuality. He told one student she was not “sexual enough” to play a certain role. He also told that student, “You walk into a room and your tits are like bam.”

Some told investigators that Perlstein seemed to deliberately choose plays that included sexual themes or nudity.

The report tells of two instances in which Perlstein was accused of kissing students. The first was in the 1990s, when the student alleged that Perlstein approached her from behind and tried to kiss her on the lips while she stood outside the Black Box Theater at CCSU.

The student managed to turn her head so the kiss landed on her cheek, according to the report, but Perlstein allegedly whispered to her that she should “not attempt to pull away when [he is] trying to kiss her.”

A few weeks later the student confronted Perlstein and told him that he had made her uncomfortable and he should never attempt to do that again. The student told investigators that Perlstein was most concerned during that exchange about whether she had reported the incident to the university.

The report said that during his interview with the investigators, Perlstein denied engaging in the alleged conduct or said it was the result of a “misunderstanding.” In the case involving the student outside the Black Box theater, the report said Perlstein claimed “he was merely trying to congratulate her after she allegedly told him that she was ‘getting married.'”

The investigators said this is not “credible given the fact that the student was already married when she enrolled in the university a few years earlier.”

Perlstein also disputed the account of a student in which he was found by CCSU to have engaged in “inappropriate behavior/sexual harassment.” The student accused him of kissing her, hugging her and touching her buttocks. Perlstein said he had been having an “emotional” not “sexual” conversation with her and kissed her on the cheek, but he denied touching her buttocks.

According to Perlstein, the CCSU staff member at the time told him that “if we call it sexual harassment, it will go away.” Perlstein claimed that he was told that otherwise, there was a “high likelihood” that the matter would be pursued with authorities by the student’s “crazy father,” the report said. Perlstein therefore accepted the findings of the CCSU report because he thought it would end the inquiry, according to the Shipman & Goodwin report.

Anna Kelly, who was the student in this incident and is now in her mid-30s living in Hartford, said she is encouraged to know the report will be “a catalyst to move the school forward — that it’s going to bring about actual change and actual consequences for these people who have gone unchecked and unpunished for a long time.”

In his interview, the report said, Perlstein admitted that he engaged in a consensual relationship with a student he was teaching and advising in 2013, but claimed it was limited to a one or two weeks while he was advising her.

But the report said that “substantial electronic communications” between the professor and the student demonstrate that their inappropriate relationship lasted for “an extended period of time” from 2013 until the summer of 2014 when the student graduated, with some breaks along the way.

In August 2013, Perlstein was disciplined by the university for having a relationship with a student he was teaching and advising but the report says it is clear that both before and after that, Perlstein continued to advise, assist and direct activities involving the student.

Perlstein said the relationship with the student, whether before or after she graduated, was consensual and not coercive, the report said. But the student told the investigators that she did not believe the relationship was “fully consensual on her part.”

Because Perlstein was her adviser for her honors thesis, the student told investigators she believed she needed his assistance to successfully complete her project and graduate.

“She claims that she felt as though she had no choice but to capitulate to his demands,” the report said.

Evidence of their ongoing relationship can be found in multiple texts included in the report including one from early 2014, the report said, in which Perlstein says, “Sorry about attacking your butt … it was aggressive and wrong …have a swell day. Love yoi [sic] ”

The texts included in the report depict a controlling and manipulative relationship in which Perlstein tried to keep the relationship going while the student tried to break it off, but feared that doing so might harm her academic and theater career.

“The extensive communications demonstrate that he engaged in a long-term sexual relationship significantly beyond what any reasonable person would view as appropriate between a professor and student,” the report said. The report said further that the text messages demonstrate that Perlstein was aware his actions were wrong.

Ashley Malloy, who has identified herself as the young woman who had the long relationship with Perlstein and who is now in a graduate school theater program in San Francisco said the reports offers “some relief that the truth is finally coming out but the fact that it’s this long overdue definitely doesn’t take the sting out of what has happened.”

“To just read in no uncertain terms the extent to which the administration was aware of what was going on,” Malloy said, “is so disheartening and destroyed whatever little bit of faith I had left in the institution.”

But she said she does applaud Toro’s actions.

Delventhal admits kissing at least five students

During his interview, Delventhal admitted that he probably kissed at least five students on the neck and forehead.

Delventhal told investigator that this was a way of expressing his endearment for a student and explained that this was the manner in which he was kissed by female members of his family. He said he did not see it as inappropriate or sexual in nature.

However, at least one student told investigator that his kisses made her uncomfortable.

The investigators found that Delventhal “knew or should have known” that such contact was inappropriate and not in compliance with university policies.”

As the type of the FOLIO I present the _Sperm Whale_; of the OCTAVO, the _Grampus_; of the DUODECIMO, the _Porpoise_. FOLIOS. Among these I here include the following chapters:—I. The _Sperm Whale_; II. the _Right Whale_; III. the _Fin-Back Whale_; IV. the _Hump-backed Whale_; V. the _Razor Back Whale_; VI. the _Sulphur Bottom Whale_. BOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER I. (_Sperm Whale_).—This whale, among the English of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale, and the Physeter whale, and the Anvil Headed whale, is the present Cachalot of the French, and the Pottsfich of the Germans, and the Macrocephalus of the Long Words. He is, without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe; the most formidable of all whales to encounter; the most majestic in aspect; and lastly, by far the most valuable in commerce; he being the only creature from which that valuable substance, spermaceti, is obtained. All his peculiarities will, in many other places, be enlarged upon. It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do. Philologically considered, it is absurd. Some centuries ago, when the Sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality, and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish; in those days spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known in England as the Greenland or Right Whale. It was the idea also, that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the first syllable of the word literally expresses. In those times, also, spermaceti was exceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but only as an ointment and medicament. It was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine, in the course of time, the true nature of spermaceti became known, its original name was still retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity. And so the appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti was really derived. BOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER II. (_Right Whale_).—In one respect this is the most venerable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly hunted by man. It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen; and the oil specially known as “whale oil,” an inferior article in commerce. Among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately designated by all the following titles: The Whale; the Greenland Whale; the Black Whale; the Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right Whale. There is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously baptised. What then is the whale, which I include in the second species of my Folios? It is the Great Mysticetus of the English naturalists; the Greenland Whale of the English whalemen; the Baleine Ordinaire of the French whalemen; the Growlands Walfish of the Swedes. It is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic seas; it is the whale which the American fishermen have long pursued in the Indian ocean, on the Brazil Banks, on the Nor’ West Coast, and various other parts of the world, designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds. Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the English and the right whale of the Americans. But they precisely agree in all their grand features; nor has there yet been presented a single determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction. It is by endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences, that some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate. The right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length, with reference to elucidating the sperm whale. BOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER III. (_Fin-Back_).—Under this head I reckon a monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and Long-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the Atlantic, in the New York packet-tracks. In the length he attains, and in his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale, but is of a less portly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to olive. His great lips present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting folds of large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin, from which he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin is some three or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder part of the back, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed end. Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible, this isolated fin will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the surface. When the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with spherical ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and wavy hour-lines graved on it. On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes back.

Samuel Marx (January 26, 1902, New York City – March 2, 1992, Los Angeles) was an American film producer, screenwriter and book author.
Life.
Marx was born to a Jewish family. and started working in 1919 as an office boy at the New York office of Universal Pictures, where he met Irving Thalberg, then secretary to Universal boss Carl Laemmle.
On May 24, 1930, he arrived at the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) Studios and was hired by Thalberg as Story Editor, the executive in charge of the screenwriting department.
Following Irving Thalberg's death in 1936, Marx became a producer and was behind a number of popular films, including "Lassie Come Home" (1943) and "Son of Lassie" (1945). During the 1950s he began working as an executive producer for Desilu Productions, where he was responsible for films and shows such as "The General Electric Hour". During the 1970s, he returned to writing books, such as "Mayer and Thalberg: The Make-Believe Saints" (1975). Marx also helped Hollywood historians with their research for television shows. One such show, the TNT special series "MGM: When the Lion Roars", was telecast in 1992 during the month Marx died of heart failure at age 90.
"Deadly Illusions".
In 1990, Samuel Marx and Joyce Vanderveen published "Deadly Illusions". Marx was MGM's Story Editor and a friend of both Paul Bern (husband of actress Jean Harlow) and Irving Thalberg at the time of Bern's death.
In 1932, Marx had gone to Bern's house before the police were informed of the body's discovery. Thalberg told Marx that Bern was dead, and that he should not go inside, but rather he should go home. The next day, Marx was among the studio executives who were told by Louis B. Mayer that, to avoid scandal, the death would have to be ruled "suicide because of impotence".
In the 1980s, Marx re-investigated the case, scrutinizing the available evidence. He concluded that Louis B. Mayer and Howard Strickling, MGM's head of publicity, with Irving Thalberg's collusion, had ordered the evidence be tampered with before the police arrived.
Marx concluded that Bern was murdered by his former common law wife, Dorothy Millette. Two days after Bern's death Millette jumped from the Delta King, a ferryboat traveling from San Francisco to Sacramento. Her shoes and her jacket were found on the boat, while her body was found a few days later by men fishing on the Sacramento River.
Marx also concluded that the alleged "suicide note" had in fact been written by Bern some weeks prior to his death. Bern had given roses to Harlow to apologize for a minor quarrel about the secluded location of their home. With the roses was a note later presented as a "suicide note" by Los Angeles District Attorney Buron Fitts, who was bribed by MGM to suppress the case.

Chincha Alta

Chincha Alta is a Peruvian city located in the Ica Region. A major port at the mouth of the Chincha River, it is the capital of Chincha Province.
Geography.
The City of Chincha Alta is located 200 kilometers south of Lima, in the Chincha Province of the Ica Region of Peru. The city covers an area of 2988 km2 and has a population of 56,085.
History.
Pre-Chincha era.
The first inhabitants of the area arrived at the beginning of the ninth century. These people are known as the "Pre-Chincha". The historian Luis Cánepa Pachas puts the date of the arrival of the Pre-Chincha at sometime in the tenth century. The rudimentary Pre-Chincha culture was centered on fishing and shell gathering. The origin of the Pre-Chincha people is still uncertain.
Chincha era.
In the eleventh century, a more advanced and warlike people known as the Chincha arrived in the coastal area. The Chincha had developed systems of architecture, agriculture and irrigation. The Chincha came to dominate the original inhabitants of the area. Some aspects of the original Pre-Chincha culture were absorbed by the newcomers. The word Chincha is derived from "Chinchay" or "Chinchas" or "Cinca" which means "ocelot" in Chincha Quechua. The Chincha worshiped an ocelot god, and believed themselves to be descended from ocelots, who gave them their warlike and dominating tendencies. The Chincha fertilized their fields with dead birds and guano, and this knowledge was passed on to later peoples. The Chincha learned seafaring skills from the Pre-Chincha, and may have traveled as far as Central America by boat.
Inca era.
Between 1458 and 1460, the Chincha were conquered by the armies of the Inca Empire led by Tupac Inca Yupanqui during the reign of his father, Pachacuti. The Chincha area became an important part of the Inca Empire, and the Inca valued the Chincha for their agricultural knowledge, military skill and trade routes.
Colonial era.
The Chincha region was then conquered by the Spanish, the area suffered a 99 percent decline in population in the first 85 years of Spanish rule and many places regressed into wilderness, Africans brought by the Spanish began to settle in the region en masse, some of the Chincha's surrounding areas became a haven for fugitive African slaves known by the Spanish as Cimarrones.
Modern era.
In the early 19th Century, Chincha was known to British mariners as Chinca or Chinka. In late 1806, the British privateers "Port au Prince" and "Lucy" collaborated in capturing some Spanish vessels off the coast there and engaged in some inconclusive battles with the Spanish frigate "Astraea".
The Chincha Islands, which are off the coast of Peru near Chincha and Pisco, were the focal point of the Chincha Islands War between Peru and Spain between 1864 and 1866.
2007 earthquake.
The city, along with others near the Pacific coast, was damaged during the 2007 Peru earthquake.
Culture.
African art and music.
Afro-Peruvian culture has thrived in Chincha Alta, and the Afro-Peruvian residents of El Carmen district practice many traditional dances. The use of the Cajón drum, maracas and other traditional instruments figure prominently in Afro-Peruvian music, which is popular throughout the region. Traditional dances are performed during the Christmas season.
Afro-Peruvian folk culture.
During February the "Verano Negro" (literally "Black Summer") festival is held, celebrating Afro-Peruvian food, music, culture and dance. The cuisine of the Chincha Alta area is considered distinct from other parts of Peru, because of its African background.
Anthem.
It was composed in 1984 by Mrs. Ana Maria del Solar and Manolo Andrade Avalos, creators of the music and lyrics respectively, and approved by Municipal Resolution No. 1440 on 30 October of the same year. It has a chorus and three verses which commend and exalt the beauty of the Chincha region as well as the courage and heroism of its people.

Alfred Desenclos

Alfred Desenclos (7 February 1912 – 3 March 1971) was a French composer of (modern) classical music. Desenclos was a self-described "romantic" whose music is highly expressive and atmospheric and rooted in rigorous compositional technique.
To support his large family (he was one of ten children), Desenclos had to renounce continuing his general studies and work as an industrial designer in the textile industry until the age of 20, but in 1929, he entered the Conservatory in Roubaix, France, to study piano. Until that time, he had played only as an amateur. He was admitted to the Conservatoire de Paris in 1932, where he won prizes in fugue, harmony, composition and accompaniment, supporting himself by fulfilling the role of 'maître de chapelle' (Kapellmeister) at the church of Notre-Dame-de-Lorette, in the 9th arrondissement of Paris.
His sacred music belongs to the tradition begun by Saint-Saëns and continued by Fauré. He won the Prix de Rome in 1942, the year in which he co-wrote (with André Theurer) the music to the film "The Blue Veil".
Desenclos was the director of his alma mater, the Conservatoire de Roubaix, from 1943 to 1950 (where one of his pupils was film-maker Claude Chabrol's favourite composer Pierre Jansen) and taught harmony at the Conservatoire de Paris from 1967 to his death at the age of 59.
Desenclos's "Messe de requiem" was written in 1963 and published by Durand et Fils in 1967. In 1999, the piece was reprinted under the name of Atlanta-based composer Tristan Foison. Foison's mass was given its "American premiere" on 18 May 1999 in a performance by the Capitol Hill Chorale; soon after, the piece was discovered to be a note-for-note duplicate of Desenclos's.
The oeuvre of Alfred Desenclos, most of which was little-known outside the world of liturgic music during his lifetime, has enjoyed a strong revival in the concert hall and the recording studio over the last two decades, his 'Quatuor de saxophones' in particular establishing itself in the 20th century chamber music repertoire.
Alfred Desenclos's son Frédéric Desenclos (1961-) is an instrumentist who has performed internationally and currently is the organist at the Chapelle Royale of the Palace of Versailles.

Judo at the 2008 Summer Olympics

Judo competitions at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing were held from August 9 to August 15 at the Beijing Science and Technology University Gymnasium.
This was the fifth Olympics for Driulys González (Cuba), Mária Pekli (Australia), Ryoko Tamura-Tani (Japan). The only other judokas to compete at five Olympics are Belgian Robert Van de Walle and Puerto Rican judoka-bobsledder Jorge Bonnet.
Qualification.
Together with 366 directly qualified athletes, there will be 20 invitational places from a Tripartite Commission (genders and categories are yet to be decided), making up a total athlete quota of 386 athletes—217 men, 147 women and 22 places not yet allocated to a gender.
An NOC may enter up to one athlete per weight category. The qualifying places will be allocated as follows:
 Two additional places will be awarded to this union, but gender and weight categories are to be defined.
 If the host nation qualifies athletes directly through the world championships or Asian continental qualification system, the reserved entry places will be reallocated as part of the Asian continental qualification.
Continental qualification places will be allocated through the ranking system based on the major tournaments on the continent (continental championships, qualification tournaments). More important tournaments and tournaments closer to the Olympics will carry more points. Deadline for the unions to confirm the places was May 21, 2008.


A:

Standard section 14.7.1/11 says

It is unspecified whether or not an implementation implicitly instantiates a virtual member function of a class template if the virtual member function would not otherwise be instantiated.

However, for a typical vtable implementation, instantiating any constructor of the class requires a vtable for the class to exist, which must contain a pointer to the specialization's virtual function definition.  So in practice the virtual function will probably be instantiated.


Q:

Show that $S_5$ does not have a quotient group isomorphic to $S_4$

Show that $S_5$ does not have a quotient group isomorphic to $S_4$.

If we to assume that $H$ is such a group, than $H$ must be normal in $S_5$ and $|H|=|S_5|/|S_4|=5$. So $H$ must be isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/5\Bbb Z$.
That's as far as my logic goes. I couldn't arrive at a contradiction.
Any ideas?

A:

The possible candidates for such an $H$ are the subgroups of $S_5$ that are cyclic of order 5.  All elements of $S_5$ of order 5 are given by $5$-cycles.  However, the subgroup generated by a 5-cycle is not normal, so no $H$ can exist, as desired.

A:

The kernel of a surjective homomorphism from $S_5$ to $S_4$ would have order $|S_5|/|S_4|=5.$ This is impossible because: $S_5$ has $1+4!=25$ elements of order $1$ or $5$; the image of each of those $25$ elements must have order $1$ or $5$ in $S_4$; but $S_4$ has no elements of order $5,$ so those $25$ elements must all belong to the kernel of the homomorphism.

Q:

If I have 10 apples and cut them in two pieces, how many apples do I have now?

A:

If you have 10 apples and cut each of them into two equal pieces, you would still have 10 apples. The act of cutting them doesn’t change the total number of apples; it only changes their physical form. 🍎🔪

Forum of Private Business

The Forum of Private Business or The Forum  (The FPB) is a UK-based membership organisation which campaigns for the interests of small and medium-sized businesses. A member-funded organisation, it offers practical business advice and help, as well as offering a range of products and services to help its members save money. The Forum was established in 1977, is a non-party political organisation and represents over 25,000 UK businesses.

Background
The Forum (the FPB)  was founded by Stan Mendham in 1977. Previously, Mendham had run an engineering business but was becoming increasingly concerned by the lack of understanding of smaller businesses in the economy and mounting red tape. He studied member-based organisations for smaller businesses in America and Canada, and decided to create a British equivalent.


Es war einmal ein mutiges und kluges Eichhörnchen namens Svenja, das in einem wunderschönen Wald lebte. Svenja war im ganzen Wald für ihr schnelles Denken und ihre Tapferkeit bekannt. Und ebenso war sie immer bereit, ihren Freunden in der Not zu helfen.
Eines Tages war Svenja unterwegs, um Nüsse für den Winter zu sammeln, als sie ein seltsames Geräusch hörte, das von einem nahen Baum kam. Sie kletterte auf den Baum, um nachzusehen, was da los war. Dann sah sie eine Gruppe fieser Vögel, die einen kleinen, hilflosen Vogel ärgerten.
Svenja war sofort klar, dass sie eingreifen musste. Also fasste sie schnell einen Plan. Sie sammelte so viele Nüsse ein, wie sie tragen konnte, und warf die Nüsse auf die fiesen Vögel. Sie zielte so gut, dass die meisten Nüsse die fiesen Vögel direkt am Kopf trafen. Die fiesen Vögel waren von dem plötzlichen Angriff überrascht und flogen verärgert davon.
Der kleine Vogel war Svenja dankbar, dass sie ihn vor den fiesen Vögeln gerettet hatte, und bedankte sich mit einem fröhlichen Zwitschern. Von diesem Tag an war Svenja als das mutigste und freundlichste Eichhörnchen des Waldes bekannt, und sie half weiterhin allen, die in Not waren, wann immer sie konnte.


Hagar: *leaning against the tavern counter.* “Melinda, have you ever wondered what lies beyond the forest? The one that stretches out like a dark, ancient tapestry.”

Melinda: *wiping down a mug.* “Beyond the forest? Hagar, you know as well as I do that it’s forbidden. The elders say there are creatures lurking there, waiting to snatch anyone who dares to cross the boundary.”

Hagar: *grinning.* “Forbidden fruit always tastes the sweetest, my dear. What if there’s a hidden world, untouched by our mundane lives? What if there are secrets waiting to be unraveled?”

Melinda: *rolling her eyes.* “You’re a dreamer, Hagar. But dreams can lead to nightmares. I’ve heard tales of lost souls who ventured too far. They say they become part of the forest itself, their whispers carried by the wind.”

Hagar: *leaning in closer.* “And what if we could find a way to break the curse? To discover what lies beyond? Imagine the stories we’d tell, the songs we’d sing!”

Melinda: *softening.* “Hagar, sometimes I think you’re the only light in this dreary village. But remember, curiosity killed the cat.”

Hagar: *grinning wider.* “Ah, but Melinda, satisfaction brought it back.”


Ere now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his quarter-deck, taking regular turns at either limit, the binnacle and mainmast; but in the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been added how that sometimes in these walks, when most plunged in his mood, he was wont to pause in turn at each spot, and stand there strangely eyeing the particular object before him. When he halted before the binnacle, with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass, that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of his purpose; and when resuming his walk he again paused before the mainmast, then, as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin there, he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness, only dashed with a certain wild longing, if not hopefulness. But one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it, as though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them. And some certain significance lurks in all things, else all things are little worth, and the round world itself but an empty cipher, except to sell by the cartload, as they do hills about Boston, to fill up some morass in the Milky Way. Now this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked somewhere out of the heart of gorgeous hills, whence, east and west, over golden sands, the head-waters of many a Pactolus flows. And though now nailed amidst all the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes, yet, untouchable and immaculate to any foulness, it still preserved its Quito glow. Nor, though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands, and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach, nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last. For it was set apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end; and however wanton in their sailor ways, one and all, the mariners revered it as the white whale’s talisman. Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night, wondering whose it was to be at last, and whether he would ever live to spend it. Now those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the sun and tropic token-pieces. Here palms, alpacas, and volcanoes; sun’s disks and stars; ecliptics, horns-of-plenty, and rich banners waving, are in luxuriant profusion stamped; so that the precious gold seems almost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories, by passing through those fancy mints, so Spanishly poetic. It so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy example of these things. On its round border it bore the letters, REPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR: QUITO. So this bright coin came from a country planted in the middle of the world, and beneath the great equator, and named after it; and it had been cast midway up the Andes, in the unwaning clime that knows no autumn. Zoned by those letters you saw the likeness of three Andes’ summits; from one a flame; a tower on another; on the third a crowing cock; while arching over all was a segment of the partitioned zodiac, the signs all marked with their usual cabalistics, and the keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at Libra. Before this equatorial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by others, was now pausing. “There’s something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and towers, and all other grand and lofty things; look here,—three peaks as proud as Lucifer. The firm tower, that is Ahab; the volcano, that is Ahab; the courageous, the undaunted, and victorious fowl, that, too, is Ahab; all are Ahab; and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe, which, like a magician’s glass, to each and every man in turn but mirrors back his own mysterious self. Great pains, small gains for those who ask the world to solve them; it cannot solve itself. Methinks now this coined sun wears a ruddy face; but see! aye, he enters the sign of storms, the equinox! and but six months before he wheeled out of a former equinox at Aries! From storm to storm! So be it, then. Born in throes, ’tis fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs! So be it, then! Here’s stout stuff for woe to work on. So be it, then.” “No fairy fingers can have pressed the gold, but devil’s claws must have left their mouldings there since yesterday,” murmured Starbuck to himself, leaning against the bulwarks. “The old man seems to read Belshazzar’s awful writing. I have never marked the coin inspectingly. He goes below; let me read. A dark valley between three mighty, heaven-abiding peaks, that almost seem the Trinity, in some faint earthly symbol. So in this vale of Death, God girds us round; and over all our gloom, the sun of Righteousness still shines a beacon and a hope. If we bend down our eyes, the dark vale shows her mouldy soil; but if we lift them, the bright sun meets our glance half way, to cheer. Yet, oh, the great sun is no fixture; and if, at midnight, we would fain snatch some sweet solace from him, we gaze for him in vain! This coin speaks wisely, mildly, truly, but still sadly to me. I will quit it, lest Truth shake me falsely.” “There now’s the old Mogul,” soliloquized Stubb by the try-works, “he’s been twigging it; and there goes Starbuck from the same, and both with faces which I should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long. And all from looking at a piece of gold, which did I have it now on Negro Hill or in Corlaer’s Hook, I’d not look at it very long ere spending it. Humph! in my poor, insignificant opinion, I regard this as queer. I have seen doubloons before now in my voyagings; your doubloons of old Spain, your doubloons of Peru, your doubloons of Chili, your doubloons of Bolivia, your doubloons of Popayan; with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles, and joes, and half joes, and quarter joes. What then should there be in this doubloon of the Equator that is so killing wonderful? By Golconda! let me read it once. Halloa! here’s signs and wonders truly! That, now, is what old Bowditch in his Epitome calls the zodiac, and what my almanac below calls ditto. I’ll get the almanac and as I have heard devils can be raised with Daboll’s arithmetic, I’ll try my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with the Massachusetts calendar. Here’s the book. Let’s see now. Signs and wonders; and the sun, he’s always among ’em. Hem, hem, hem; here they are—here they go—all alive:—Aries, or the Ram; Taurus, or the Bull and Jimimi! here’s Gemini himself, or the Twins. Well; the sun he wheels among ’em. Aye, here on the coin he’s just crossing the threshold between two of twelve sitting-rooms all in a ring. Book! you lie there; the fact is, you books must know your places. You’ll do to give us the bare words and facts, but we come in to supply the thoughts. That’s my small experience, so far as the Massachusetts calendar, and Bowditch’s navigator, and Daboll’s arithmetic go. Signs and wonders, eh? Pity if there is nothing wonderful in signs, and significant in wonders! There’s a clue somewhere; wait a bit; hist—hark! By Jove, I have it! Look you, Doubloon, your zodiac here is the life of man in one round chapter; and now I’ll read it off, straight out of the book. Come, Almanack! To begin: there’s Aries, or the Ram—lecherous dog, he begets us; then, Taurus, or the Bull—he bumps us the first thing; then Gemini, or the Twins—that is, Virtue and Vice; we try to reach Virtue, when lo! comes Cancer the Crab, and drags us back; and here, going from Virtue, Leo, a roaring Lion, lies in the path—he gives a few fierce bites and surly dabs with his paw; we escape, and hail Virgo, the Virgin! that’s our first love; we marry and think to be happy for aye, when pop comes Libra, or the Scales—happiness weighed and found wanting; and while we are very sad about that, Lord! how we suddenly jump, as Scorpio, or the Scorpion, stings us in the rear; we are curing the wound, when whang come the arrows all round; Sagittarius, or the Archer, is amusing himself. As we pluck out the shafts, stand aside! here’s the battering-ram, Capricornus, or the Goat; full tilt, he comes rushing, and headlong we are tossed; when Aquarius, or the Water-bearer, pours out his whole deluge and drowns us; and to wind up with Pisces, or the Fishes, we sleep. There’s a sermon now, writ in high heaven, and the sun goes through it every year, and yet comes out of it all alive and hearty. Jollily he, aloft there, wheels through toil and trouble; and so, alow here, does jolly Stubb. Oh, jolly’s the word for aye! Adieu, Doubloon! But stop; here comes little King-Post; dodge round the try-works, now, and let’s hear what he’ll have to say. There; he’s before it; he’ll out with something presently. So, so; he’s beginning.” “I see nothing here, but a round thing made of gold, and whoever raises a certain whale, this round thing belongs to him. So, what’s all this staring been about? It is worth sixteen dollars, that’s true; and at two cents the cigar, that’s nine hundred and sixty cigars. I won’t smoke dirty pipes like Stubb, but I like cigars, and here’s nine hundred and sixty of them; so here goes Flask aloft to spy ’em out.”
