# --- Mergekit Example: Nearswap ---
# Method: Interpolates the base model with parameters from a secondary model
#         primarily where they are already similar.

base_model: "org/primary-model"        # The model whose structure is mostly preserved 
models:
  - model: "org/secondary-donor-model" # Exactly one other model 
merge_method: nearswap
parameters:
  t: 0.001                             # Controls interpolation strength. Higher values increase influence of secondary model for similar params. [cite: 90, 91, 195]
