# --- Mergekit Example: Karcher Mean ---
# Method: Computes the Karcher mean (Riemannian barycenter) of model parameters. [cite: 24, 129]
#         No base_model is used.

models:
  - model: "org/diverse-model-P"         # No per-model weights are used by the karcher method itself,
                                         # but you might use them if you were to combine karcher with slices in a complex setup.
                                         # For a direct karcher merge, all models contribute to finding the mean.
  - model: "org/diverse-model-Q"
